However, few studies have considered using radiative transfer models to estimate the nitrogen concentration (Cn) of crops. This study is based on the PIOSL-5 model to generate a large number of simulation datasets, namely the PIOSLSD dataset. The successive projections algorithm (SPA) is used to select nitrogen-related features. A crop Cn inversion model based on the PIOSL-5 model is constructed using five models: Extreme Learning Machine, Genetic Algorithm Optimized Extreme Learning Machine, Particle Swarm Optimization Optimized Extreme Learning Machine, Third Generation Non Dominated Genetic Algorithm Optimized Extreme Learning Machine (NSGA-III-ELM), and Bat Algorithm Optimized Extreme Learning Machine. The model is compared with traditional data-driven methods and the accuracy of the model is verified using three datasets: RICE23, LOPEX93, and CALIFORNIA. The results showed that the nitrogen characteristic bands of the PIOSLSD dataset filtered by SPA were 1070, 1150, 1405, 1535, and 1725 nm. The Cn prediction based on the NSGA-III-ELM model, which uses these 5 feature bands as inputs, has the best performance. The determination coefficients of the validation set are 0.814, 0.785, and 0.792, respectively. The Cn inversion model based on the PIOSL-5 model constructed in this article achieves remote sensing prediction of crop nitrogen mechanism model, which has certain mechanistic significance for nitrogen nutrition management of crops and improving nitrogen utilization efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inversion; Leaf; Nitrogen; PIOSL; Radiative transfer model","Crops; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Large datasets; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nitrogen fertilizers; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Crop leaves; Inversion; Inversion models; Leaf; Learning machines; Model-based OPC; Nitrogen concentrations; PIOSL; Radiative transfer modelling; Successive projections algorithm; Nitrogen; algorithm; crop improvement; detection method; leaf area; radiative transfer; remote sensing; simulation","","","Authors would like to thank the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission (Ispra, Italy) for providing the public dataset LOPEX, which can be downloaded from http://opticleaf.ipgp.fr/index.php?page=home and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for providing the CALIFORNIA dataset, which can be downloaded from https://ecosis.org/package/fresh-leaf-spectra-to-estimate-leaf-traits-for-california-ecosystems .

Driven by advanced manufacturing technologies, the key factor affecting product quality has shifted from various manufacturing stages to the final assembly stage. Currently, automated assembly solutions are constrained by technical bottlenecks and cost pressures, making them difficult to implement; as a result, assembly tasks still rely heavily on manual operations. To adapt to fierce market competition and production changes, manufacturers must strive to automate pipeline assembly. For this purpose, this paper proposes an automated flexible tooling system for pre-welding positioning and assembly quality evaluation. The system adopts a multiple collaborative robots’ architecture and performs reconfigurable assembly in a human-robot collaboration (HRC) mode. The specific implementation steps are as follows: first, workers install connectors on the fixtures of each robot's end effector, adjust them to an appropriate posture, and obtain the spatial posture data of the connectors through scanning; subsequently, a method for determining registration schemes is developed on the basis of the structural characteristics of the connectors. The feature elements are further extracted, and data registration is completed through human-computer interaction (HCI); then, an improved NSGA-III method that integrates the Levenshtein Distance Congestion Elimination (LCE) method is proposed. This method incorporates three types of constraints: obstacle avoidance constraints for the collaborative movement of multiple collaborative robots, feasibility constraints for robot movement, and rotational angle constraints for connectors. It solves the multi-objective optimization problem among total assembly time, uniformity of time allocation, and energy consumption, enabling rapid and efficient robot posture reconstruction; finally, simulation and experimental verification of the system are conducted. The field assembly verification results demonstrate that the assembly quality is significantly improved compared with that of traditional and recent representative algorithms. The proposed assembly method has an accuracy ranging from 0.0452 mm to 0.0807 mm, with an assembly precision of approximately 0.0607 mm, and ensures the stability and predictability of the assembly quality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aero-engine pipeline; Flexible tooling system; Human-robot collaboration; Multi-objective optimization; Reconfigurable assembly","Aircraft engines; Bending tools; Collaborative robots; End effectors; Engines; Flexible manipulators; Pipelines; Robotic assembly; Aero-engine; Aero-engine pipeline; Assembly quality; Flexible tooling; Flexible tooling system; Human-robot collaboration; Multi-objectives optimization; Reconfigurable; Reconfigurable assembly; Tooling systems; Multiobjective optimization","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful for the support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 51605475), the Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Plan Project (grant no. 2022-MS-040), and the Central Guidance for Local Scientific and Technological Development Funds (grant no. 2021JH6/10500123).; Funding text 2: This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 51605475), the Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Plan Project (grant no. 2022-MS-040), and the Central Guidance for Local Scientific and Technological Development Funds (grant no. 2021JH6/10500123).","Chen, Weijiao, Semi-analytic modeling and experimental verification of arbitrary aero-engine complex spatial pipeline, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 131, pp. 505-534, (2024); Khabbazi, Arash J., Mixing hydrogen into natural gas distribution pipeline system through Tee junctions, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 49, pp. 1332-1344, (2024); Ren, Yao, A review of pipe cutting, welding, and NDE technologies for use in fusion devices, Fusion Engineering and Design, 202, (2024); Liu, Shaoli, A universal, rapid and accurate measurement for bend tubes based on multi-view vision, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 78758-78771, (2019); Cheng, Xiaoqi, Shape from apparent contours for bent pipes with constant diameter under perspective projection, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 182, (2021); Bao, Yan, Recent progress in flexible supporting technology for aerospace thin-walled parts: A review, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 35, 3, pp. 10-26, (2022); Fan, Wei, An automated reconfigurable flexible fixture for aerospace pipeline assembly before welding, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 97, 9-12, pp. 3791-3811, (2018); Zhang, Shengwen, An intelligent decision-making system for assembly process planning based on machine learning considering the variety of assembly unit and assembly process, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 121, 1-2, pp. 805-825, (2022); Guo, Feiyan, Locating method and motion stroke design of flexible assembly tooling for multiple aircraft components, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 107, 1-2, pp. 549-571, (2020); Abellán-Nebot, José V., Quality prediction and compensation in multi-station machining processes using sensor-based fixtures, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 28, 2, pp. 208-219, (2012)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","02786125","","JMSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015518130"

In light of this, this study makes a breakthrough by applying the NSGA-III algorithm to the field of film and television scene optimization, achieving the best balance between scene aesthetics and functionality through the construction of a multi-objective optimization strategy. This effectively solves the problem of multi-rights protection and balance in film and television scene design. In 10 classic film and television scene optimization experiments, the scheme generated by the algorithm increased the visual effects score by 12 %, the plot fit by 9 %, and reduced costs by 15 %. At the same time, with its efficient computing power, the original scene design cycle of several weeks has been greatly shortened to several hours, significantly saving manpower and material resources. In addition, the results of this research were successfully demonstrated in the pilot of commercial projects across three different thematic genres (action, sci-fi, and costume), reducing the construction cycle by an average of 20 %, increasing the material reuse rate by 18 %, and reducing the number of reworks due to design flaws by 30 %. This research not only provides an innovative technical path for the optimization of film and television scenes but also opens up a new direction for the film and television industry to achieve a win-win situation of artistic innovation and economic benefits. It fills the gap of technology application in this field and has important theoretical and practical value. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Film and television director; NSGA-Ⅲ; Scene optimization","Economic and social effects; Economics; Entertainment industry; Film growth; Artistic quality; Deep integrations; Design method; Film and television director; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-ⅲ; Optimisations; Production efficiency; Scene designs; Scene optimization; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Ðurasević, Marko, Combining single objective dispatching rules into multi-objective ensembles for the dynamic unrelated machines environment, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 80, (2023); Ma, Haiping, A comprehensive survey on NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization and applications, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 12, pp. 15217-15270, (2023); Panagant, Natee, A Comparative Study of Recent Multi-objective Metaheuristics for Solving Constrained Truss Optimisation Problems, Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 28, 5, pp. 4031-4047, (2021); Ðurasević, Marko, Constructing ensembles of dispatching rules for multi-objective tasks in the unrelated machines environment, Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering, 30, 3, pp. 275-292, (2023); Tang, Hongtao, A DQL-NSGA-III algorithm for solving the flexible job shop dynamic scheduling problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 237, (2024); Zhang, Qingquan, An efficient many objective optimization algorithm with few parameters, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 83, (2023); Zhong, Changting, Starfish optimization algorithm (SFOA): a bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization compared with 100 optimizers, Neural Computing and Applications, 37, 5, pp. 3641-3683, (2025); Meng, Zeng, Application of state-of-the-art multiobjective metaheuristic algorithms in reliability-based design optimization: a comparative study, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 66, 8, (2023); Kesireddy, Adarsh, Elite Multi-Criteria Decision Making—Pareto Front Optimization in Multi-Objective Optimization, Algorithms, 17, 5, (2024); C, Gnana Kousalya, Feature selection on real-time application using hybrid of flamingo search algorithm and improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III, Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, (2024)","","Academic Press","","","","","","27729419","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014918694"

However, existing studies often rely on complex neural architectures, leading to excessive computational time, and fail to integrate point and interval predictions, disconnecting deterministic and uncertainty analysis, thereby affecting prediction efficiency. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel three-output wind speed prediction system via constrained multi-objective optimization. The framework minimizes mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and prediction interval normalized average width (PINAW) while maximizing prediction interval coverage (PICP), with adjustable coverage constraints for diverse interval demands. Leveraging the outlier-robust extreme learning machine (ORELM) as the predictor, the system outputs point values and interval bounds simultaneously, addressing the volatility of wind speed time series and multi-output complexity. To solve the optimization problem, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (CKNSGA-III) is proposed, integrating Henon chaotic mapping and a knee-oriented mechanism to boost optimization efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed prediction system has significant advantages in interval prediction performance, point prediction accuracy, and runtime, and has passed significance and robustness tests. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced optimization algorithm; Constrained many-objective optimization problem; Interval prediction; Three-output neural network; Wind speed point prediction","Complex networks; Computational efficiency; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Wind effects; Wind forecasting; Wind power; Advanced optimization algorithm; Constrained many-objective optimization problem; Interval prediction; Many-objective optimizations; Neural-networks; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Three-output neural network; Wind speed; Wind speed point prediction; Constrained optimization; Uncertainty analysis","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 72471049).","undefined, (2024); Nix, David A., Estimating the mean and variance of the target probability distribution, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks - Conference Proceedings, 1, pp. 55-60, (1994); Odell, Patricia M., Maximum likelihood estimation for interval-censored data using a Weibull- based accelerated failure time model, Biometrics, 48, 3, pp. 951-959, (1992); Heskes, Tom M., Practical confidence and prediction intervals, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 176-182, (1997); Khosravi, Abbas, Lower upper bound estimation method for construction of neural network-based prediction intervals, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 22, 3, pp. 337-346, (2011); Li, Kaiwen, An Evolutionary Multiobjective Knee-Based Lower Upper Bound Estimation Method for Wind Speed Interval Forecast, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 26, 5, pp. 1030-1042, (2022); Phan, Quoc Thang, Enhancing One-Day-Ahead Probabilistic Solar Power Forecast With a Hybrid Transformer-LUBE Model and Missing Data Imputation, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 60, 1, pp. 1396-1408, (2024); Shi, Zhichao, Direct Interval Forecast of Uncertain Wind Power Based on Recurrent Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 9, 3, pp. 1177-1187, (2018); Lv, Mengzheng, A multi-input and dual-output wind speed interval forecasting system based on constrained multi-objective optimization problem and model averaging, Energy Conversion and Management, 319, (2024); He, Yaoyao, A Novel Neural Network-Based Multiobjective Evolution Lower Upper Bound Estimation Method for Electricity Load Interval Forecast, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 54, 5, pp. 3069-3083, (2024)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012122268"

Optimization approaches currently face limitations when trying to balance exploration and exploitation especially when resources become limited. MaOCO represents the Many-Objective Cheetah Optimization Algorithm which draws its concepts from the hunting behavior of cheetahs. MaOCO includes adaptive search functions that use attack and sit-and-wait approaches to optimize exploration and exploitation capabilities. MaOCO produces hypervolume (HV) results that exceed NSGA-III and MaOMVO by 50% while also delivering inverse generational distance (IGD) results which reach 40% better than both competing methods. The algorithm demonstrates superior efficiency in solving complex MaOPs, because it requires lower computational costs by 15%.

These advantages have led to their widespread adoption in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous vehicles. However, as application scenarios diversify and service environments become more demanding, there is an ongoing need to improve the comprehensive performance of 3D chips. To address these challenges, this study constructs a Through-Silicon Via (TSV) based 3D chip model with 25 links, 22 microstructures, 8 materials, and 39 design parameters. Drawing on multi-physics and electromagnetic transmission theories, three performance indexes are defined according to the structural characteristics of 3D chip, and then used for the establishment and error propagation analysis of the Gaussian-regression-based surrogate models. Subsequently, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is employed to perform multi-objective optimization, generating a Pareto front for enhancing the thermomechanical-electrical performance of the chip. The optimal solution is then identified using the multi-factor comprehensive ranking method (MFCRM). Results demonstrate significant improvements over the initial design and relevant study, the optimization achieves a 13.50 % enhancement in thermal performance, a 12.00 % improvement in mechanical performance, and an 8.58 % increase in electrical performance.

Through dynamic and kinematic analyses of key components of the pickup header, the critical influencing factors for pickup efficiency were identified as: forward speed of the pickup header, rotational speed of the spring-tooth roller pickup, and rotational speed of the spiral conveyor. A flexible discrete element model of rapeseed plants was developed using the Bonding V2 model, using EDEM-RecurDyn co-simulation, single-factor and quadratic orthogonal rotational composite experiments were conducted with missed-pickup loss rate and splash loss rate as evaluation metrics. The optimal parameter combination, determined via the NSGA-III algorithm and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, was: forward speed of 600.5 mm/s, roller pickup speed of 101.5 r/min, and spiral conveyor speed of 162.6 r/min, achieving a missed-pickup loss rate of 2.44 % and splash loss rate of 3.92 %. Field validation tests showed relative errors of 0.26 % and 0.11 % between simulated and measured loss rates, respectively. The optimized header reduced total loss rate from 7.82 % (initial design) to 6.73 %, achieving a 44.84 % reduction compared to conventional harvesters (12.20 %). The developed DEM-MBD coupled model systematically elucidates the loss-reduction mechanisms of rapeseed pickup headers in hilly and mountainous areas, establishing a novel theoretical framework and technical pathway for low-loss harvesting equipment design and adaptive optimization in mountainous agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DEM-MBD coupling; Loss reduction mechanism; NSGA-III algorithm; Pickup header; Rapeseed","Belt conveyors; Belt drives; Harvesters; Pickups; Rollers (machine components); DEM-MBD coupling; Forward speed; Hilly and mountainous areas; Loss rates; Loss reduction; Loss reduction mechanism; NSGA-III algorithm; Pickup header; Rapeseed; Reduction mechanisms; Oilseeds; algorithm; digital elevation model; equipment; experimental study; mountain region; optimization","","","This project was supported by the National Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System Program ( CARS-12 ) from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a TBM intelligent decision-making system integrating rock information recognition, excavation performance prediction and operating parameter regulation, which can provide quantitative guidance for construction. Firstly, TBM field excavation data of 7023 tunnel rings were collected from the HJ tunnel in Northeast China, and three working conditions suitable for TBM were defined, namely soft rock strata, balanced strata and hard rock strata. Then, two multi-output prediction models based on tabular deep learning architecture were developed to accurately predict rock information and performance indicators, respectively. The mean relative root mean square error (aRRMSE), mean symmetrical mean absolute percentage error (aSMAPE), and mean correlation coefficient (aCC) of the two models were 0.3079, 0.0693, 0.9524 and 0.2257, 0.0733, 0.9740, respectively. The model performance is superior to classic algorithms such as RF, MLPNN, LightGBM, and SVR. Subsequently, Black-winged Kite algorithm is improved using Weighted Chebyshev Scalarization Strategy and Tent Chaotic Map Strategy, and the MOBK algorithm is proposed. A multi-objective optimization principle is further established, effectively considering tunneling efficiency, construction cost, engineering experience, and equipment safety. The optimization of parameters under three working conditions is realized. Compared with optimization algorithms such as MOPSO (Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization) and NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III), The MOBK algorithm performed the best, and achieves excellent overall performance improvement (36.63%) with the minimum operating parameter adjustment (18.05%). Finally, intelligent decision-making system is constructed based on multi-output prediction model and multi-objective optimization method. The engineering application results show that the proposed system can automatically identify geological environment and provide recommended values of operating parameters in the actual excavation process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intelligent decision system; Multi-objective optimization; Performance prediction; Rock information identification; Tunnel boring machine","Construction equipment; Cost engineering; Decision making; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Parameter estimation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Screening; Tunneling (excavation); Tunneling machines; Tunnels; Uncertainty analysis; Decision-making systems; Information identifications; Intelligent decision systems; Intelligent decision-making; Multi-objectives optimization; Operating parameters; Performance prediction; Rock information identification; Tunnel boring; Tunnel boring machine; Mean square error; Multiobjective optimization","","","This research was supported by Young Scientist Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52309171), and Distinguished Young scientists (No. 52125904), and the National funded postdoctoral researcher program of China (No. GZB20230589), and the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (No. 2024MD764019).","Zhang, Limao, Perceiving safety risk of buildings adjacent to tunneling excavation: An information fusion approach, Automation in Construction, 73, pp. 88-101, (2017); She, Lei, An empirical method for estimating TBM penetration rate using tunnelling specific energy, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 144, (2024); Li, Chaoyi, Analysis on the crown convergence deformation of surrounding rock for double-shield TBM tunnel based on advance borehole monitoring and inversion analysis, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 103, (2020); Salimi, Alireza R., Introducing Tree-Based-Regression Models for Prediction of Hard Rock TBM Performance with Consideration of Rock Type, Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering, 55, 8, pp. 4869-4891, (2022); Hou, Shaokang, Intelligent decision-making for TBM tunnelling control parameters using multi-objective optimization, Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, 17, 5, pp. 2943-2963, (2025); Hansen, Tom F., Towards reinforcement learning - driven TBM cutter changing policies, Automation in Construction, 165, (2024); Yang, Haiqing, Effects of joints on the cutting behavior of disc cutter running on the jointed rock mass, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 81, pp. 112-120, (2018); Huang, Xing, Development and in-situ application of a real-time cutting tool forces monitoring system in TBM tunnelling, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 124, (2022); Xue, Yadong, Prediction of optimum TBM penetration strategy with minimum energy consumption in hard rocks, Computers and Geotechnics, 148, (2022); Kim, Kyoungyul, Prediction of tbm performance based on specific energy, Geomechanics and Engineering, 22, 6, pp. 489-496, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","14740346","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009032818"

The AGVs are known for their operational flexibility and efficiency, but efficient scheduling remains a crucial issue due to the conflicting factors, including deviation penalties for task execution times, power consumption, overall task completion time, collision risk, and utilization efficiency. To address this, this research employs a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model (MO-MIP) to formulate the scheduling problem of AGVs. The optimization algorithms, such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Reference Point-based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) are utilized to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions in solving the scheduling problem. The simulation experiment on three distinct manufacturing workshop scenarios was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the model. The outcomes illustrated that the NSGA-II and NSGA-III exhibit reduced penalty cost, power consumption, collision risk, task completion time, and higher utilization efficiency.

Current top-down, bottom-up, and synchronized decision-making methods have achieved multi-objective network-level maintenance decisions. However, these methods rarely quantify the engineering feasibility of maintenance activities, resulting in maintenance failures and resource waste. This paper employs the probability measures output by a neural network model to characterize engineering feasibility. By integrating these probability measures with pavement performance indices through the Hadamard product, segment-level maintenance decisions are generated. Based on segment-level maintenance decisions outcomes, a bottom-up network-level maintenance decision-making method is established, which comprehensively considers pavement performance, funding allocation, environmental impact, and engineering feasibility. A case study is conducted using data from a highway network in China. The results indicate that the segment-level maintenance outcomes of this method ensure that maintenance activities meet feasibility requirements, while the network-level maintenance plans can balance multiple objectives to meet actual engineering needs. In comparative experiments, the highest frequency of maintenance activity selection for this method is only 0.33, which is a reduction of 33 % and 59 % compared to the 0.49 and 0.80 of the two traditional methods, respectively, indicating better diversity in maintenance activity selection and effectively avoiding excessive use of a single maintenance resource, thus achieving sustainable maintenance practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Engineering feasibility; Multi-objective optimization; Road network-level maintenance","Repair; Resource allocation; Risk assessment; Decision-making method; Engineering feasibility; Hadamard products; Maintenance activity; Maintenance decisions; Maintenance plans; Multi-objectives optimization; Network-level maintenance; Road network; Road network-level maintenance; Maintainability","","","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Numbers: 52308447 and 52378445; and Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, Grant Number: KYCX24_0447.","Abu Dabous, Saleh, Sustainability-informed multi-criteria decision support framework for ranking and prioritization of pavement sections, Journal of Cleaner Production, 244, (2020); Alsugair, Abdullah M., Artificial Neural Network Approach for Pavement Maintenance, Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 12, 4, pp. 249-255, (1998); Ameri, Mahmoud, An executive model for network-level pavement maintenance and rehabilitation planning based on linear integer programming, Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization, 16, 2, pp. 795-811, (2020); Bao, Shi Tai, Pavement maintenance decision making based on optimization models, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 20, (2021); Cao, Dongping, Multi-objective optimisation for urban road network maintenance based on spatial design network analysis: trade-offs in performance, environmental impacts and costs, International Journal of Pavement Engineering, 25, 1, (2024); Cao, Liping, Decision-making optimization model for the targeted sustainable maintenance of a complex road network, Journal of Cleaner Production, 434, (2024); Cao, Ruijun, Multi-objective optimization for maintaining low-noise pavement network system in Hong Kong, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 88, (2020); Cao, Rui, Network-level pavement maintenance and rehabilitation planning considering uncertainties using chance-constrained programming, International Journal of Pavement Engineering, 25, 1, (2024); Chen, Wang, Multi-objective optimization for pavement maintenance and rehabilitation decision-making: A critical review and future directions, Automation in Construction, 130, (2021); Chen, Wang, Multi-objective decision support system for large-scale network pavement maintenance and rehabilitation management to enhance sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, 380, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09521976","","EAAIE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007323419"

Until now, various metaheuristic methods have been proposed to solve the problem. However, designing effective methods is not trivial and heavily depends on experts' knowledge. As a research hotspot in recent years, a few deep reinforcement learning methods have been tried to solve the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with symmetric distance and time matrices. However, due to the complex traffic conditions, the travel distance and time between two nodes are probably asymmetric in real-world scenarios. This article introduces a multiobjective edge-based learning algorithm (MOEL) to tackle this issue. In this method, a single neural network model is established and trained to approximate the whole Pareto front of the problem. The edge features, including travel distance and time matrices, are fully learned and used to construct high-quality solutions. MOEL is compared against three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods (MODRL/D-EL, PMOCO, EMNH) and five metaheuristic methods (NSGA-II, MOEA/D, NSGA-III, MOEA/D-D, MOIA). Experimental results on the real-world instances indicate that MOEL significantly outperforms all competitors, improving IGD by up to 99.80% and HV by up to 62.84%. In addition, MOEL achieves a maximum runtime reduction of 88.65% compared to the deep reinforcement learning methods, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness for solving the problem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep reinforcement learning; Multiobjective optimization; Vehicle routing problem","Reinforcement learning; Vehicle routing; Distance matrix; Edge-based; Meta-heuristic methods; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Reinforcement learning method; Reinforcement learnings; Time matrix; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Vehicle Routing Problems; Deep reinforcement learning","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 62202314 , 62072483 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China ( 2018A0303130055 , 2022A1515010417 , 2018A030310664 ), the Shenzhen Fundamental Research Fund under Grant No. 0220820010535001 and the Education Planning Project of Guangdong Province \u201CThe Exploration and Practice of Academic Value-Added Evaluation Under Artificial Intelligence Empowerment\u201D ( 2024GXJK782 ).","Management Science, (1959); Konstantakopoulos, Grigorios D., Vehicle routing problem and related algorithms for logistics distribution: a literature review and classification, Operational Research, 22, 3, pp. 2033-2062, (2022); Lenstra, Jan Karel, Complexity of vehicle routing and scheduling problems, Networks, 11, 2, pp. 221-227, (1981); Bogyrbayeva, Aigerim, Machine Learning to Solve Vehicle Routing Problems: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 25, 6, pp. 4754-4772, (2024); Emmerich, Michael T.M., A tutorial on multiobjective optimization: fundamentals and evolutionary methods, Natural Computing, 17, 3, pp. 585-609, (2018); Decision Sciences, (2016); Zajac, Sandra, Objectives and methods in multi-objective routing problems: a survey and classification scheme, European Journal of Operational Research, 290, 1, pp. 1-25, (2021); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003276738"

This study presents a bi-level multi-objective optimization framework that addresses two tightly coupled problems: dynamic job scheduling and skill-based team formation. The job scheduling component assigns geographically dispersed inspection tasks to mobile teams while minimizing multiple conflicting objectives, including travel distance, tardiness, and workload imbalance. Concurrently, the team formation component ensures that each team satisfies fault-specific skill requirements by optimizing team cohesion and compactness. To solve the bi-objective team formation problem, we propose HMOO-AOS, a hybrid algorithm integrating six metaheuristic operators under an NSGA-II framework with an Upper Confidence Bound-based Adaptive Operator Selection. Experiments on datasets of up to seven instances demonstrate statistically significant improvements ((Formula presented.)) in solution quality, skill coverage, and computational efficiency compared to NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D variants, with computational complexity (Formula presented.) (time complexity), (Formula presented.) (space complexity). A cloud-integrated system architecture is also proposed to contextualize the framework within real-world solar inspection operations, supporting real-time data integration, dynamic rescheduling, and mobile workforce coordination.

However, the limited computational resources and dynamic topology of in-vehicle terminals pose challenges such as delay, load imbalance, and bandwidth consumption. To address these, a three-layer vehicular network architecture based on cloud–edge–end collaboration was proposed, with V2X technology used for multi-hop transmission. Models for delay, energy consumption, and edge caching were designed to meet the requirements for low delay, energy efficiency, and effective caching. Additionally, a dynamic pricing model for edge resources, based on load-awareness, was proposed to balance service quality and cost-effectiveness. The enhanced NSGA-III algorithm (ADP-NSGA-III) was applied to optimize system delay, energy consumption, and system resource pricing.

When comparing the results obtained from both methods, we found that NSAG-III was the best alternative for selecting parameters in the turning operation, with fewer tool wear, more efficient use of energy consumption, and more variants of material removal rate. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AISI 316L austenitic stainless steel; Non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm II and III; Sustainable turning","Cutting; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Screening; Sorting; Turning; Wear of materials; 316L austenitic stainless steel; 316L steel; AISI 316l austenitic stainless steel; Cutting regimes; Energy-consumption; Multi-criteria; Non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm II and III; Optimisations; Sorting genetic algorithm; Sustainable turning; Cutting tools","","","This work has been partially funded by the FONCYT project with the number COAH-2022-C19-C147, which allowed us to carry out the research and achieve the results presented in this work.","Pereira-Neto, Octavio Manuel, Cryogenic and minimum quantity lubrication for an eco-efficiency turning of AISI 304, Journal of Cleaner Production, 139, pp. 440-449, (2016); Revista Ingenieria Uc, (2018); Tebaldo, Vincenzo, Sustainability in machining: “Eco-friendly” turning of Inconel 718.

For this reason, cleaning supports increases both costs and production time, as well as sustainability concerns due to the increasing work volume in the world of metal additive manufacturing. In addition, cleaning of support structures is usually performed manually by the operator, and since this situation can not provide the expected mechanical properties, precise surface, and dimensional tolerances from the part, the operator’s effectiveness in the process must be reduced. For these reasons, there is a need to clean support structures successfully and sustainably. This study investigated the sustainable milling of additively manufactured as-built and annealed support structures from Ti-6Al-4V alloy using different feed values under dry, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) with vegetable-based cutting oil and MQL with graphene nanoparticle-reinforced nanofluid (N-MQL) cutting conditions in terms of cutting force, energy consumption, and circumferential and areal damage. After that, a novel hybrid optimization was performed by combining the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) multi-objective optimization method and the Comprehensive Distance Based Ranking (COBRA) multi-criteria decision-making method. The N-MQL method improved the cutting force, energy consumption, circumferential damage, and areal damage by 15.2%, 0.086%, 18.4%, and 16.8%, respectively, compared to the dry cutting condition. It has been determined by the novel hybrid optimization that milling the as-built Ti-6Al-4V alloy support structure under the N-MQL cutting condition at a feed value of 0.05–0.0554 mm/rev is optimum in terms of both machining performance and sustainability. It has been concluded that cutting the support structures from the additively manufactured components before the annealing process is more appropriate, rather than annealing them simultaneously with the primary portion, then cutting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","COBRA; Graphene nanofluid, NSGA-III; Minimum quantity lubrication; Support structure; Ti-6Al-4V","Annealing; Cutting; Energy utilization; Fits and tolerances; Genetic algorithms; Lubrication; Multiobjective optimization; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Petroleum additives; Reinforcement; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Structures (built objects); Sustainable development; Ternary alloys; Vanadium alloys; Comprehensive distance based ranking; Cutting conditions; Distance-based; Graphene nanofluid, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Graphenes; Minimum quantity lubrication; Nanofluids; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Support structures; Ti-6al-4v; Milling (machining)","","","This work was supported by the Research Fund for International Scientists (RFIS) of the National Natural Science Foundation of China GIA24002, and Open fund of International Joint Laboratory of Sustainable Manufacturing, Ministry of Education, China (grant number 56XBF24017).","Badoniya, Pushkal, A state-of-the-art review on metal additive manufacturing: milestones, trends, challenges and perspectives, Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 46, 6, (2024); Abd-Elaziem, Walaa, On the current research progress of metallic materials fabricated by laser powder bed fusion process: a review, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 20, pp. 681-707, (2022); Öztürk, Osman, Enhancing formability of Ti-6Al-4V cylindrical cups by pulsating hydroforming process: Experimental, numerical and microstructural investigations, Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal, 50, (2024); Shamsaei, Nima, An overview of Direct Laser Deposition for additive manufacturing; Part II: Mechanical behavior, process parameter optimization and control, Additive Manufacturing, 8, pp. 12-35, (2015); Dareh Baghi, Alireza, Effective post processing of SLM fabricated Ti-6Al-4 V alloy: Machining vs thermal treatment, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 68, pp. 1031-1046, (2021); Graziosi, Serena, A vision for sustainable additive manufacturing, Nature Sustainability, 7, 6, pp. 698-705, (2024); Khanna, Navneet, Cost Modelling for Powder Bed Fusion and Directed Energy Deposition Additive Manufacturing, Journal of Manufacturing and Materials Processing, 8, 4, (2024); Khanna, Navneet, Comparison of sustainable cooling/lubrication strategies for drilling of wire arc additively manufactured Inconel 625, Tribology International, 200, (2024); Raval, Parth, Energy consumption and economic modelling of performance measures in machining of wire arc additively manufactured Inconel-625, Sustainable Materials and Technologies, 32, (2022); Demir, Utku, Sustainability assessment and optimization for milling of compacted graphite iron using hybrid nanofluid assisted minimum quantity lubrication method, Sustainable Materials and Technologies, 38, (2023)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333015; 02683768","","IJATE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013566793"

To achieve precise control of the HTRS output speed under variable working conditions, this paper explores the benefits of multi-objective optimization in the control field. A multi-objective optimization problem is established for an optimal fuzzy fractional order PID (OFFOPID) controller, tailored for fractional order HTRS working under both unload and load conditions. By introducing fractional order calculus operators and specifically optimizing the gains, rule bases, and membership functions, the OFFOPID controller enhances the traditional fuzzy PID controller and provides greater flexibility. In this multi-objective optimization problem, steady-state error (SSE), integral square error (ISE), and overshoot percentage (OP) are selected as the objective functions to ensure precise control accuracy, rapid response, and smooth transient behavior. To obtain the optimal Pareto frontier, the Pareto local search-nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (PLS-NSGAIII) is proposed, with hybrid coding for population individuals specific to the OFFOPID framework. In this algorithm, the improved individual selection, crossover, and mutation operators enhance global search, while individual local search, conducted based on Pareto optimality, improves local search capabilities. Experiments show that the OFFOPID controller provides rapid and accurate responses for highly inertial HTRS, outperforming traditional controllers. Compared to three other multi-objective optimization algorithms on benchmark test functions and HTRS applications, the PLS-NSGAIII achieves lower GD and IGD values and higher HV values, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving HTRS problem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hydraulic turbine regulating system; Multi-objective optimization; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Optimal fuzzy fractional order PID controller; Pareto local search","Genetic algorithms; Kaplan turbines; Local search (optimization); Membership functions; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Fractional order; Fractional-order PID controllers; Hydraulic turbine regulating system; Local search; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Optimal fuzzy fractional order PID controller; Pareto local search; Multiobjective optimization","","","This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 62203339 , 62173262 , 62073250 and 62003249 .","Afshari, Hamid, Constrained multi-objective optimization algorithms: Review and comparison with application in reinforced concrete structures, Applied Soft Computing, 83, (2019); Aguila-Camacho, Norelys, Fractional order controllers for throughput and product quality control in a grinding mill circuit, European Journal of Control, 51, pp. 122-134, (2020); Ali, Aijaz, A review on FPGA implementation of fractional-order systems and PID controllers, AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications, 177, (2024); Anuradha, K.

In order to improve the maintenance quality and material utilization efficiency during the maintenance process, this paper proposes a bidirectional maintenance method based on gear rack transmission and its related equipment. Based on the working principle, a geometric relationship model was established, which combines the structural parameters of the mold, punch, and gear system. Simultaneously, it solves the problem of motion attitude analysis of conjugate tooth profiles under non-standard meshing conditions, aiming to establish a constraint relationship between stamping motion and structural design parameters. On this basis, a constrained optimization model was developed by integrating multi-objective optimization theory to maximize maintenance efficiency. The NSGA-III algorithm is used to solve the model and obtain the Pareto front solution set. Subsequently, three optimal parameter configurations were selected for simulation analysis and experimental platform construction. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the veneer repair time ranges from 0.6 to 1.8 seconds, depending on the stamping speed. A reduction of 28 mm in die height decreases the repair time by approximately 0.1 seconds, resulting in an efficiency improvement of about 14%. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in repairing veneer defects. Vibration measurements further verify the system’s stable operation under parametric modeling and optimization design. The main vibration response occurs during the meshing and disengagement phases between the gear and rack. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","meshing motion; multi-objective optimization; parametric modeling; veneer defect repair; vibration response","Constrained optimization; Defects; Efficiency; Gears; Repair; Simulation platform; Structural design; Vibrations (mechanical); Defect repair; Meshing motion; Modeling objectives; Multi-objectives optimization; Parametric models; Repair methods; Repair time; Stampings; Veneer defect repair; Vibration response; Multiobjective optimization; Veneers","","","This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572023AW61), the Major Scientific and Technological Achievements Transformation Project of Heilongjiang Province (CG23013), and the Heilongjiang Province \u201Cdouble first class\u201D discipline collaborative innovation achievement project (LJGXCG2024-F16).","Ferreira, Bruno Santos, Physical and Mechanical Properties of Plywood Produced with Thermally Treated Pinus taeda Veneers, Forests, 13, 9, (2022); Bekhta, Pavlo, Effect of short-term thermomechanical densification of wood veneers on the properties of birch plywood, European Journal of Wood and Wood Products, 76, 2, pp. 549-562, (2018); Li, Wanzhao, Understanding the interaction between bonding strength and strain distribution of plywood, International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives, 98, (2020); Shi, Jiahao, Defect detection of industry wood veneer based on NAS and multi-channel mask R-CNN, Sensors, 20, 16, pp. 1-17, (2020); Dong, Yingda, Research on the veneer defect image enhancement algorithm based on AMEF-AGC+, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Zhong, Lihui, Identification and localization of veneer knot defects based on parallel structure fusion approach, European Journal of Wood and Wood Products, 82, 5, pp. 1301-1317, (2024); Hughes, Mar K., Plywood and other veneer-based products, pp. 69-89, (2015); Cang, Sheng, Image restoration on the defects of knots in the veneer based on image decomposition, 3, pp. 906-910, (2010); U S Patent, (2012); U S Patent, (2015)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277080","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014325952"

This study establishes an optimization model for the mining sequence of ion-adsorption rare earth mining districts that incorporates environmental costs, using the net present value (NPV) of the mining district and the net present value of environmental costs (C<inf>E</inf>) as objective functions. The model is applied to optimize the mining sequence of Mining District L. The results demonstrate that (1) Four algorithms, namely NSGA-II, NSGA-III, IBEA, and MOEA/D, were selected for comparison. The analysis based on the distribution of solutions, hypervolume values (HV), and computational time revealed that the IBEA exhibited superior performance. (2) The IBEA was employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem, yielding a set of 30 optimal solutions.

(3) The weighted method was employed to transform the multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective formulation.

Disassembly line layout plays a crucial role among the factors that affect recycling efficiency. Subsequently, this study proposed a mixed-parallel straight and two-sided disassembly line layout, combining the advantages of the three layouts to enhance the efficiency of recycling EoL products. Additionally, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model was developed to minimize the number of workstations, idle time balancing, demand, and hazard indices. To solve the mixed-parallel straight and two-sided disassembly line balancing problem (k-MPSTDLBP), this study designed a two-layer non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-Ⅱ) with universal encoding and decoding mechanisms. The algorithm's effectiveness was validated by solving two hybrid cases using both the MINLP model and the two-layer NSGA-II. Moreover, comparative analyses with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III, the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm, and the improved firefly algorithm demonstrated the superiority of the two-layer NSGA-II. Finally, the two-layer NSGA-II was applied to a hybrid case study involving four types of EoL products under both the mixed-parallel straight and two-sided disassembly line and straight disassembly line layouts, confirming the higher recycling efficiency of the k-MPSTDLBP. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of the two-layer NSGA-II on the k-MPSTDLBP was analyzed using orthogonal experiments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disassembly line balancing; End-of-life products; Evolutionary algorithm; Mixed-integer non-linear programming; Mixed-parallel straight and two-sided lines; Two-layer non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II","Genetic algorithms; Integer linear programming; Integer programming; Mixed-integer linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Recycling; Screening; Sorting; Disassembly line; Disassembly line balancing; End-of-life products; Line layout; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Mixed-parallel straight and two-sided line; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); NSGA-II; Two-layer; Two-layer non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II; Efficiency","","","This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52375268, 52342505, 72401239 ), the Foundation for Humanities, Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China (No. 23YJA630139 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China (No. E2024105031 ), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No. 2024ZHCG0059 ), and Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province (Nos. 2025ZNSFSC0425, 2024NSFSC1048 ).","Ilgin, Mehmet Ali, An approach to quantify the financial benefit of embedding sensors into products for end-of-life management: A case study, Production Planning and Control, 25, 1, pp. 26-43, (2014); Avikal, Shwetank, A Kano model, AHP and M-TOPSIS method-based technique for disassembly line balancing under fuzzy environment, Applied Soft Computing, 25, pp. 519-529, (2014); Xu, Binshi Shixu, Progress of remanufacturing engineering and future technology expectation, Advances in Manufacturing, 1, 1, pp. 8-12, (2013); Ren, Yaxian, A novel Q-learning based variable neighborhood iterative search algorithm for solving disassembly line scheduling problems, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 80, (2023); Zhang, Caixia, Layout design of a mixed-flow production line based on processing energy consumption and buffer configuration, Advances in Manufacturing, 9, 3, pp. 369-387, (2021); Liang, Wei, Modeling and Optimization of Parallel Disassembly Line Balancing Problem with Parallel Workstations, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 19, 11, pp. 10684-10692, (2023); Liang, Wei, Improved social spider algorithm for partial disassembly line balancing problem considering the energy consumption involved in tool switching, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 7, pp. 2250-2266, (2023); Didden, Jeroen B.H.C., Genetic algorithm and decision support for assembly line balancing in the automotive industry, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 10, pp. 3377-3395, (2023); Güler, Elif, Advances in partial disassembly line balancing: A state-of-the-art review, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 188, (2024); Kose, Yildiz, Evaluation of disassembly line layouts using an integrated fermatean fuzzy decision-making methodology: An application for refrigerator disassembly line, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 190, (2024)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008805210"

Traditional approaches often struggle with balancing conflicting objectives, such as minimizing the response time, reducing energy consumption, and maximizing broker profits. This paper presents NSGA-III-GKM++, an advanced multi-objective optimization model that integrates the NSGA-III evolutionary algorithm with an enhanced K-means++ clustering technique to improve the convergence speed, solution diversity, and computational efficiency. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated using Deb–Thiele–Laumanns–Zitzler (DTLZ) and Unconstrained Function (UF) benchmark problems and real-world cloud brokerage scenarios. Comparative analysis against NSGA-II, MOPSO, and NSGA-III-GKM demonstrates the superiority of NSGA-III-GKM++ in achieving high-quality tradeoffs between performance and cost. The results indicate a 20% reduction in the response time, 15% lower energy consumption, and a 25% increase in the broker’s profit, validating its effectiveness in real-world deployments. Statistical significance tests further confirm the robustness of the proposed model, particularly in terms of hypervolume and Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) metrics.

This hybrid model integrates LSTM, GRU, and CNN architectures to predict stock prices accurately using historical market data. The process begins with historical stock market data to develop a foundational understanding of market behaviours. This data is then precisely processed and prepared for the HDL model, ensuring the model has the highest quality input to generate accurate predictions. This study utilizes the HDL model to capture temporal dependencies in stock prices, enabling precise future price predictions. The IMOPO model seeks to maximize return, skewness, and entropy while simultaneously minimizing variance and kurtosis, all within the constraints of budget and transaction costs, to construct a resilient portfolio. The IMOPO model is solved using four data types: historical data, actual and predicted data from the HDL model during the testing phase, and future forecast data from the HDL model, offering a comprehensive evaluation framework. The Many-objective optimization is solved using four evolutionary algorithms: Genetic Algorithms, NSGA-II, NSGA-III, an Aspiration Level-based NSGA-III and NSDE-R. These algorithms address the Many-objective nature of the problem, providing flexible and adaptive portfolio solutions tailored to different investor preferences. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the IMOPO model's outputs across different return aspiration levels, focusing on variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy. This analysis identified key trade-offs between all objectives. The developed IMOPO offers investors a well-rounded, risk-adjusted portfolio optimized for future performance through rigorous data analysis. Our research highlights the advantages of combining HDL techniques with evolutionary algorithms, providing a practical approach for making informed decisions in stock market analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AL NSGA-III; Evolutionary algorithms; Hybrid deep learning; Investment strategy; LSTM; Many-objective portfolio optimization; NSDE-R; Sensitivity analysis","Budget control; Deep learning; Financial markets; Investments; Sensitivity analysis; AL NSGA-III; Hybrid deep learning; Investment strategy; Learning models; LSTM; Many-objective portfolio optimization; NSDE-R; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio optimization models; Sensitivity analyzes; Risk perception","","","","Abolmakarem, Shaghayegh, Predictive multi-period multi-objective portfolio optimization based on higher order moments: Deep learning approach, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 183, (2023); Agnihotri, Shubha, Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III with stochastic matrix-based population to solve multi-objective solid transportation problem, Soft Computing, 27, 9, pp. 5641-5662, (2023); Agnihotri, Shubha, VARIANTS OF GENETIC ALGORITHM TO SOLVE MULTI-OBJECTIVE INTERVAL SOLID TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM, Palestine Journal of Mathematics, 11, Special Issue 3, pp. 189-201, (2022); Ahsan, Md Manjurul, Effect of Data Scaling Methods on Machine Learning Algorithms and Model Performance, Technologies, 9, 3, (2021); Aksaraylı, Mehmet, A polynomial goal programming model for portfolio optimization based on entropy and higher moments, Expert Systems with Applications, 94, pp. 185-192, (2018); Babaei, Sadra, Multi-objective portfolio optimization considering the dependence structure of asset returns, European Journal of Operational Research, 244, 2, pp. 525-539, (2015); Sanjay Bajaj, Aaishwarya S., Multi-objective quasi oppositional Jaya algorithm to solve multi-objective solid travelling salesman problem with different aspiration level, International Journal of Systems Science: Operations and Logistics, 10, 1, (2023); Behera, Jyotirmayee, Prediction based mean-value-at-risk portfolio optimization using machine learning regression algorithms for multi-national stock markets, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 120, (2023); Bruni, Renato, Stock Market Index Data and indicators for Day Trading as a Binary Classification problem, Data in Brief, 10, pp. 569-575, (2017); Chen, Wei, A novel two-stage method for well-diversified portfolio construction based on stock return prediction using machine learning, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 63, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004730339"

Optimizing this process requires the design and integration of discrete forming stages to establish an optimized manufacturing plan. This paper presents a multistage deep drawing recommendation system that combines a novel forming quality evaluation function, called the Integrated Multistage Deep Drawing Evaluation Function (IMSDDEF), with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III). The system aims to suggest near-optimal forming plans with a minimal number of forming stages, while accounting for blank material properties, target-net shape, product quality, and the intermediate failures. Artificial Neural Network surrogate models for classification and regression have been developed, trained on finite element simulation data with plastic anisotropy to predict product formability, minimum height, and thickness based on design variables at each forming stage. Flowchart-based decision-making logic in IMSDDEF integrates these surrogate models to determine key performance metrics, including the appropriate number of forming stages, as well as the product's shape loss and minimum thickness. IMSDDEF coordinates with NSGA-III to derive Pareto-optimal solutions within a minute, enabling trade-offs between conflicting objectives. From the resulting Pareto front, the most suitable forming plan is selected through detailed comparative analysis. Experimental validation is conducted to confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed system. The novel function IMSDDEF could be further generalized to other sequential material processing optimization scenarios to optimize manufacturing plans beyond multistage deep drawing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Multistage deep drawing; NSGA-III; Optimization; Surrogate models","Computer control; Damage detection; Failure analysis; Model predictive control; Molding; Perforating; Plastics casting; Preforming; Reliability analysis; Statistical process control; Deep-drawing process; Evaluation function; Forming quality; Multi-stages; Multistage deep drawing; Neural-networks; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimisations; Surrogate modeling; Deep drawing","","","This research was supported by the BK21 Program ( NRF-2120240815267 ) through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) , funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE, Republic of Korea) , and by the Basic Research Program ( NRF-2020R1F1A1066221 ) through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) , funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT ( MSIT , Republic of Korea).","Min, Dong-kyun, A study on process improvements of multi-stage deep-drawing by the finite-element method, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 54, 1-4, pp. 230-238, (1995); Thuillier, Sandrine, Experimental and numerical study of reverse re-drawing of anisotropic sheet metals, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 125-126, pp. 764-771, (2002); Pegel, Hendrik, Influence of cell dimensions and housing material on the energy density and fast-charging performance of tabless cylindrical lithium-ion cells, Energy Storage Materials, 60, (2023); Abdelmaguid, Tamer F., A dynamic programming approach for minimizing the number of drawing stages and heat treatments in cylindrical shell multistage deep drawing, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 66, 3, pp. 525-532, (2013); Kim, Seho, Design modification in a multi-stage rectangular cup drawing process with a large aspect ratio by an elasto-plastic finite element analysis, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 113, 1-3, pp. 766-773, (2001); Kim, Seho, Tool design in a multi-stage drawing and ironing process of a rectangular cup with a large aspect ratio using finite element analysis, International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 42, 7, pp. 863-875, (2002); Park, C.

The many-to-one and carry-to-send nature of nodes leads to congestion. The underlying node becomes a bottleneck and faces serious communication problems due to unbalanced internal network parameters. This research presents an adaptive source transmission rate optimization algorithm to resolve these issues by performing a runtime fine-tuning of the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller by applying Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III PID (N3PID) in a cascaded manner. The optimal adjustment of internal network parameters results from overcoming the drawbacks of insufficient diversity, slow convergence, and overshoot. The N3PID provides a more accurate response due to efficient and robust parameter tuning. Moreover, the optimally modified parameters are passed to a PID controller that uses the error (the variation between the instantaneous and predicted queues) as input to optimize the transmission rate for the origin node. The N3PID increases the convergence speed and accelerates the accuracy. The N3PID algorithm is assessed with PID, Particle Swam Optimization–neural PID (PNPID), Cuckoo Fuzzy PID (CFPID), and Neural Network PID (NNPID) through a simulation in Network Simulator software. The experimental results reveal that the packet delivery ratio is increased by 9.924% and the average delay is substantially reduced by 14.152% while packet loss is significantly reduced by 12.311% and minimized the energy consumption to 5.899% as compared with NNPID. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Congestion; Internet of things; NSGA-III; Optimization; Proportional integral derivative; Wireless sensor network","Adaptive transmission; Genetic algorithms; Packet loss; Wireless sensor networks; Congestion; Internal network; Network parameters; NSGA-III; Optimisations; Proportional integral derivatives; Proportional-integral-derivatives controllers; Sensors network; Transmission rates; Wireless sensor; Three term control systems","","","","Abujassar, Radwan S., A highly effective algorithm for mitigating and identifying congestion through continuous monitoring of IoT networks, improving energy consumption, Wireless Networks, 30, 5, pp. 3161-3180, (2024); Aimtongkham, Phet, Fuzzy logic rate adjustment controls using a circuit breaker for persistent congestion in wireless sensor networks, Wireless Networks, 26, 5, pp. 3603-3627, (2020); Bhatti, Kabeer Ahmed, Progressive Fuzzy PSO-PID Congestion Control Algorithm for WSNs, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 48, 2, pp. 1157-1172, (2023); Bhatti, Kabeer Ahmed, Multi-objective fuzzy krill herd congestion control algorithm for WSN, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 83, 1, pp. 2093-2121, (2024); Chowdhury, Srijit, Noncooperative gaming for energy-efficient congestion control in 6LoWPAN, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 6, pp. 4777-4788, (2020); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Fayos-Jordan, Rafael, ECO4RUPA: 5G-IoT Inclusive and Intelligent Routing Ecosystem with Low-Cost Air Quality Monitoring, Information (Switzerland), 14, 8, (2023); García-Martín, Juan Pablo, On the Combination of LR-WPAN and LPWA Technologies to Provide a Collaborative Wireless Solution for Diverse IoT, International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications, 2019-October, (2019); Grover, Amit, Rate aware congestion control mechanism for wireless sensor networks, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 61, 6, pp. 4765-4777, (2022); Gulati, Kamal, A review paper on wireless sensor network techniques in Internet of Things (IoT), Materials Today: Proceedings, 51, pp. 161-165, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002639325"

Design/methodology/approach: First, the sustainable and resilient performances of suppliers are evaluated by the proposed integrated SVN-base-criterion method (BCM)-an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision-making (TODIM) method, with consideration of the uncertainty in the decision-making process. Then, a novel multi-objective optimization model is formulated, and the best sustainable-resilient order allocation solution is found using the U-NSGA-III algorithm and TOPSIS method. Finally, based on a real-life case in the automotive manufacturing industry, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed two-stage decision model. Findings: The paper provides an effective decision tool for the SSOA process in an uncertain environment. The proposed SVN-BCM-TODIM approach can effectively handle the uncertainties from the decision-maker’s confidence degree and incomplete decision information and evaluate suppliers’ performance in different dimensions while avoiding the compensatory effect between criteria.

In the face of increasing disruptions, such as natural disasters and other operational failures, the need for robust solutions that can maintain high levels of performance before and after disruptions has become more pressing. This paper presents an improved approach to the UFLP using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III). Compared to its predecessor, NSGA-II, NSGA-III exhibits significant computational improvements, including a reduction in computation time and an enhanced capability to explore the Pareto front efficiently. The proposed method aims to provide decision makers with robust solutions that minimize the total weighted distance under normal operating conditions and maintain resilience in the event of facility failures. NSGA-III demonstrates superior computational performance by requiring less time to obtain high-quality solutions and achieving a more diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Computational experiments demonstrate a 25% improvement in Pareto front diversity and a 15% reduction in computational time compared to NSGA-II. Unlike previous methods requiring probabilistic failure data or additional resource allocation for protection, the proposed approach directly incorporates resilience considerations into the optimization process. The method allows decision-makers to identify robust facility placements that minimize the total weighted distance during normal operations and maintain performance under interruptions. Practical insights for resilient infrastructure planning are provided, supported by benchmark dataset analyses. The results underscore the efficacy of NSGA-III in achieving computational efficiency and solution diversity, advancing the state-of-the-art in multi-objective optimization for complex FLPs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crowdsourcing; Facility location problem; Heuristics; Multi-objective optimization; Pareto set; Problems; Serious video games","Crowdsourcing; Pareto principle; Resource allocation; Facility location problem; Heuristic; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Pareto set; Problem; Robust solutions; Serious video game; Uncapacitated facility locations; Video-games; Multiobjective optimization","","","The authors wish to express their profound gratitude to the Secretar\u00EDa de Ciencia, Humanidades, Tecnolog\u00EDa e Innovaci\u00F3n (SECIHTI) for its significant support.

An asynchronous PEA (APEA) is a scheme of PEAs that increases computational efficiency by generating a new solution immediately after a solution evaluation completes without the idling time of computing nodes. However, because APEA gives more search opportunities to solutions with shorter evaluation times, the evaluation time bias of solutions negatively affects the search performance. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a new parent selection method to reduce the effect of evaluation time bias in APEAs. The proposed method considers the search frequency of solutions and selects the parent solutions so that the search progress in the population is uniform regardless of the evaluation time bias. This paper conducts experiments on multi-objective optimization problems that simulate the evaluation time bias. The experiments use NSGA-III, a well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and compare the proposed method with the conventional synchronous/asynchronous parallelization. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method can reduce the effect of the evaluation time bias while reducing the computing time of the parallel NSGA-III. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asynchronous evaluation; Evaluation time bias; Evolutionary algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Parallelism; Parent selection","Computational efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Asynchronoi evaluation; Asynchronous parallel; Evaluation time bias; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; New solutions; Parallel com- puting; Parallel evolutionary algorithms; Parallelism; Parent selection; Multiobjective optimization; article; human; multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","","","This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists Grant Number JP19K20362.","Abbasi, Mahdi, An efficient parallel genetic algorithm solution for vehicle routing problem in cloud implementation of the intelligent transportation systems, Journal of Cloud Computing, 9, 1, (2020); Alba, Enrique, Parallel metaheuristics: Recent advances and new trends, International Transactions in Operational Research, 20, 1, pp. 1-48, (2013); Chitty, Darren M., A partially asynchronous global parallel genetic algorithm, pp. 1771-1778, (2021); Coello, Carlos A., Solving multiobjective optimization problems using an artificial immune system, Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 6, 2, pp. 163-190, (2005); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Depolli, Matjaž, Asynchronous master-slave parallelization of differential evolution for multi-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 21, 2, pp. 261-291, (2013); Durillo, Juan J., A study of master-slave approaches to parallelize NSGA-II, (2008); P, Geetha, A parallel chaotic sailfish optimization algorithm for estimation of DOA in wireless sensor array, Physical Communication, 51, (2022); Harada, Tomohiro, Search Progress Dependent Parent Selection for Avoiding Evaluation Time Bias in Asynchronous Parallel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms, pp. 1013-1020, (2020); Harada, Tomohiro, Parallel Genetic Algorithms: A Useful Survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 53, 4, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15729796; 15677818","","NCAOA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145206708"

The Intelligent Flood Control Decision Support System (IFCDSS) is an innovative AI framework integrating forecasting, optimization, and adaptive control for proactive urban flood management; The IFCDSS improved the pump operation efficiency by 45.4%, significantly outperforming the traditional flood control methods. What are the implications of the main findings? The IFCDSS provides a robust, adaptable AI-driven solution optimizing flood mitigation, energy efficiency, and infrastructure resilience across diverse urban contexts; It represents a significant advancement toward autonomous flood management, integrating early warnings, intelligent decision support, and real-time optimization to protect lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems from escalating climate-induced flood risks. Climate-induced extreme rainfall events are increasing the intensity and frequency of flash floods, highlighting the urgent need for advanced flood management systems in climate-resilient cities. This study introduces an Intelligent Flood Control Decision Support System (IFCDSS), a novel AI-driven solution for real-time flood forecasting and automated pump operations. The IFCDSS integrates multiple advanced tools: machine learning for rapid short-term water level forecasting, NSGA-III for multi-objective optimization, the TOPSIS for robust multi-criteria decision-making, and the ANFIS for real-time pump control. Implemented in the flood-prone Zhongshan Pumping Station catchment in Taipei, the IFCDSS leveraged real-time sensor data to deliver accurate water level forecasts within five seconds for the next 10–30 min, enabling proactive and informed operational responses. Performance evaluations confirm the system’s scientific soundness and practical utility. Specifically, the ANFIS achieved strong accuracy (R2 = 0.81), with most of the prediction errors being limited to a single pump unit. While the conventional manual operations slightly outperformed the IFCDSS in minimizing flood peaks—due to their singular focus—the IFCDSS excelled in balancing multiple objectives: flood mitigation, energy efficiency, and operational reliability. By simultaneously addressing these dimensions, the IFCDSS provides a robust and adaptable framework for urban environments. This study highlights the transformative potential of intelligent flood control to enhance urban resilience and promote sustainable, climate-adaptive development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; decision support; early warning; energy efficiency; flood control; pump operation optimization; urban drainage system","","","","This research was funded by the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan, grant numbers NSTC 112-2625-M-002-022- and 113-2313-B-002-029-MY3; the Taipei City Government, grant number H-111-99-111084-1; and National Taiwan University, grant number NTU-CC-114L894801.","Jato-Espino, Daniel, ArcUHI: A GIS add-in for automated modelling of the Urban Heat Island effect through machine learning, Urban Climate, 44, (2022); Tang, Wenjing, Study on the carbon sequestration performance and barrier mechanism of biochar cement-based vertical cutoff walls for phenol pollution in groundwater, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 12, 6, (2024); Webber, James L., Moving to a future of smart stormwater management: A review and framework for terminology, research, and future perspectives, Water Research, 218, (2022); Almulhim, Abdulaziz I., Building Urban Resilience Through Smart City Planning: A Systematic Literature Review, Smart Cities, 8, 1, (2025); Ipcc Fifth Assessment Synthesis Report Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, (2014); Alkhatib, Mohammed I.I., An Urban Acoustic Rainfall Estimation Technique Using a CNN Inversion Approach for Potential Smart City Applications, Smart Cities, 6, 6, pp. 3112-3137, (2023); Balogun, Abdul Lateef, Assessing the Potentials of Digitalization as a Tool for Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Development in Urban Centres, Sustainable Cities and Society, 53, (2020); Yereseme, Archana K., Sustainable integrated urban flood management strategies for planning of smart cities: a review, Sustainable Water Resources Management, 8, 3, (2022); Abid, Sheikh Kamran, Toward an integrated disaster management approach: How artificial intelligence can boost disaster management, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 22, (2021); Agboola, Oluwagbemiga Paul, Urban resilience in the digital age: The influence of Information-Communication Technology for sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, 428, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","26246511","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009160959"

This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method for intermodal freight transportation planning within the framework of sustainable service network design. The approach aims to balance economic efficiency and environmental sustainability by minimizing both transportation costs and delivery time. A bi-criteria mathematical model is developed and solved using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), which is well-suited for handling complex, large-scale optimization problems under multiple constraints. The aim of the study is to develop and implement this technology that balances economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and manageability of operational processes. The research includes the development of a two-criteria model that takes into account both temporal and economic parameters of the routes. The optimization method employs the NSGA-III, a well-known metaheuristic that generates a diverse set of near-optimal Pareto-efficient solutions. This enables the selection of trade-off alternatives depending on the decision-maker’s preferences and specific operational constraints. Simulation results show that the implementation of the proposed technology can reduce the costs of intermodal operators by an average of 8% and the duration of transportation by up to 50% compared to traditional planning methods. In addition, the automation of the process contributes to a more rational use of resources, reducing carbon emissions and increasing the sustainability of transportation networks. This approach is in line with the principles of sustainable economic development, as it improves the efficiency of logistics operations, reduces pressure on infrastructure and minimizes the environmental impact of the transport sector. Route optimization and digitalization of transport processes can increase resource efficiency, improve freight flow management and contribute to the long-term stability of transport systems. The developed technology of automated planning of intermodal transportation is oriented to application in large-scale production systems, providing effective management of cargo flows within complex logistics chains. The proposed method supports the principles of sustainable development by providing a formal decision-making framework that balances transportation cost, delivery time and environmental objectives. Instead of optimizing for a single goal, the model enables the identification of efficient trade-offs between economic performance and ecological impact. Moreover, by generating multiple routing scenarios under varying operational constraints, the approach enhances the adaptability and robustness of freight transportation systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbon emissions reduction; intermodal freight transport; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Pareto efficiency; service network design; sustainable logistics; transportation planning","automation; carbon emission; emission control; environmental impact; freight transport; optimization; sustainability; transportation planning","","","All authors acknowledge funding support given by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation as part of World-Class Research Center Program: Advanced Digital Technologies (contract No. 075-15-2022-311 dated 20 April 2022).","Kaack, Lynn H., Decarbonizing intraregional freight systems with a focus on modal shift, Environmental Research Letters, 13, 8, (2018); Janić, Milan, Modelling the full costs of an intermodal and road freight transport network, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 12, 1, pp. 33-44, (2007); Meyer, Tobias, Decarbonizing road freight transportation – A bibliometric and network analysis, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 89, (2020); Yamahaki, Camila, Explaining the absence of climate change integration in low-carbon sectoral policies: An analysis of Brazil's maritime cabotage policy, Case Studies on Transport Policy, 16, (2024); Barlogis, Rodolphe, Predicting container intermodal transport arrival times: An approach based on IoT data, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 29, (2025); Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel, Stay circular economy, empowerment, and natural resource utilization factual factors for SDG 12?

Like many optimization algorithms, MOCS faces challenges with premature convergence and maintaining diversity in the solution space. To address this issue, we propose an upgraded MOCS algorithm that includes a migration operator that is activated upon early convergence detection. Migration operator aims to improve exploration and exploitation by reintroducing diversity when the algorithm stagnates. The proposed algorithm, termed MG-MOCS, is evaluated using standard benchmark functions, including IMOP and ZDT problems. MG-MOCS shows significant improvements in spacing and hypervolume metrics.

This study establishes a multi-objective water resource optimization model by comprehensively considering economic, social, and ecological benefits. Based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III), we propose the I-NSGA-III algorithm by integrating reference point improvement strategies, dynamic retention of high-quality solutions, and optimized selection strategies to solve the multi-objective optimization model. A multi-system coupling coordination evaluation model is constructed to assess the final allocation schemes. Compared with some commonly used multi-objective algorithms and tested using the DTLZ series functions, the proposed algorithm demonstrates improved overall performance. Specifically, the IGD indicator decreases by 5.17–50.22%, and the HV indicator increases by 2.71–25.51% compared to NSGA-III. The proposed model is applied to Jinzhong City, China, with four scenarios set for the years 2030 and 2035 at P = 50% and P = 75% to derive reasonable water resource allocation schemes. The results show that the economic benefits range from 161.94 × 108 to 212.74 × 108 CNY, the water shortage rate is controlled between 1.38% and 10.86%, and COD emissions are maintained between 6.03 × 104 and 6.91 × 104 tons. Except for the 2030 drought scenario (P = 75%) with a coordination degree of 0.7847, classified as a medium coordination level, all other scenarios have coordination degrees greater than 0.8, indicating a good coordination level. The optimized allocation scheme can serve as a reference for the rational allocation of water resources in Jinzhong City. Moreover, the method proposed in this paper is a general approach that can be extended to other similar water-scarce cities with appropriate parameter adjustments, contributing to the sustainable development of urban water resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","coupling coordination evaluation; improved NSGA-III algorithm; Jinzhong City; multi-objective model; water resource optimization allocation","Multiobjective optimization; Rational functions; Resource allocation; Water management; Water wells; Coupling coordination evaluation; Improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III algorithm; Jinzhong city; Multi objective; Multiobjective modeling; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimization allocations; Resources optimization; Water resource optimization allocation; Waters resources; Genetic algorithms","","","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Project of China, grant 2023YFC3205701 and Guangdong Foundation for Program of Science and Technology Research, grant 2023B0202030001.","AbdulBaki, Dunia, An optimization model for the allocation of water resources, Journal of Cleaner Production, 164, pp. 994-1006, (2017); Zhang, Fengyi, Water resources allocation based on water resources supply-demand forecast and comprehensive values of water resources, Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 47, (2023); Wei, Fangliang, Simulation of water resource allocation for sustainable urban development: An integrated optimization approach, Journal of Cleaner Production, 273, (2020); Génova, Paulina, A socio-hydrological model for assessing water resource allocation and water environmental regulations in the Maipo River basin, Journal of Hydrology, 617, (2023); Heilongjiang Environ J, (2025); Water Resources and Power, (2023); Yellow River, (2020); Yellow River, (2024); Haimes, Yacov Y., On a bicriterion formation of the problems of integrated system identification and system optimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-1, 3, pp. 296-297, (1971); Haimes, Yacov Y., Multiobjectives in water resource systems analysis: The Surrogate Worth Trade Off Method, Water Resources Research, 10, 4, pp. 615-624, (1974)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007790142"

To address the limitations of low-cost, simplified dummy head–neck structures, which exhibit significant differences in mechanical properties compared to high-biofidelity dummies, a virtual–real fusion-based test method for assessing occupant head–neck injury in under-body blast impacts is proposed. A simplified dummy head–neck physical model, designed based on human biomechanical characteristics, is constructed for physical testing. A mapping test model based on 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is developed as the virtual counterpart to process physical model test data, specifically head and chest centroid accelerations, into head centroid acceleration and upper neck axial compression force matching the Hybrid III 50th numerical model. Pendulum collision tests are conducted to simulate under-body blast impacts, generating multiple sets of head and chest acceleration data. Under identical loading conditions, the head centroid acceleration and upper neck axial compression force of the Hybrid III 50th numerical model are computed. The parameters of the mapping test model are then optimized using these simulated experimental datasets based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Validation through blast experiments demonstrates that the proposed method achieves high accuracy, with errors of 10.9% for the Head Injury Criterion (HIC<inf>15</inf>) and 2.4% for upper neck maximum axial compression force compared to the Hybrid III 50th numerical model calculations. This approach effectively bridges the gap between biofidelity and cost-efficiency in dummy testing for blast impact scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blast impact injury; head–neck; mapping test model; optimize; physical model; test method; virtual–real fusion","Compression testing; Virtual addresses; Biofidelity; Blast impact injury; Head/neck; Mapping test model; Optimize; Physical modelling; Test method; Test models; Under-body blasts; Virtual–real fusion; Mapping","","","","Danelson, Kerry Ann, Comparison of ATD to PMHS Response in the Under-Body Blast Environment, Stapp car crash journal, 59, pp. 445-520, (2015); Trajkovski, Jovan, Blast response of Light Armoured Vehicles (LAVs) with flat and V-hull floor, Thin-Walled Structures, 131, pp. 238-244, (2018); Espinoza-Garcés, Carlos Alberto, Head injuries evaluation during a pipeline explosion, Results in Engineering, 21, (2024); Test Methodology for Protection of Vehicle Occupants Against Anti Vehicular Landmine Effects, (2007); Volume 2 Edition 2 Procedures for Evaluating the Protection Level of Armoured Vehicles Mine Threat, (2011); Ott, Kyle A., Comparison of Human Surrogate Responses in Underbody Blast Loading Conditions, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 142, 9, (2020); Bailey, Ann Marie, Comparison of Hybrid-III and Postmortem Human Surrogate Response to Simulated Underbody Blast Loading, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 137, 5, (2015); Bailey, Ann Marie, Comparison of hybrid-III a 158-170 nd PMHS response to simulated underbody blast loading conditions, pp. 158-170, (2013); Proceedings of the International Ircobi Conference; Bass, Cameron Dale “Dale”, A methodology for assessing blast protection in explosive ordnance disposal bomb suits, International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics, 11, 4, pp. 347-361, (2005)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007776646"

This research creates an intricate model for a fuzzy multi-objective, multi-item five-dimensional transportation problem (FMOMI5DTP), highlighting the intricacy of transportation challenges in the real world. Although classical optimization algorithms are commonly utilized for addressing transportation issues, they may struggle to fully grasp the knowledge and judgment of those making decisions. To overcome the problem, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA III) is utilized here to generate solutions that consider various levels of objectives without being dominated by others. However, to generate the solutions, NSGA III needs an initial feasible population. For this purpose, this paper suggests a structured method to effectively create an initial population to handle the FMOMI5DTP. Moreover, actual milk transportation data is gathered using Google Maps and Mapple Maps to validate the suggested model. The issue is resolved by utilizing NSGA III, which is then contrasted with the results of NSGA II, aspiration level-based NSGA III (AL-NSGA III), non-dominated sorting differential evolution based on reference point (NSDE-R), hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), Goal Programming (GP), and fuzzy programming technique (FPT). The results of the study demonstrate that NSGA-III outperforms other algorithms in both the quality and quantity of solutions for the given case study. NSGA-III generates 100 Pareto-optimal solutions, significantly more than NSDE-R, which produces 70 solutions, and NSGA-II, which yields only 7 solutions for the same population size of 100. Furthermore, the solutions obtained from NSGA-III dominate many of those produced by NSGA-II and NSDE-R, highlighting its effectiveness in maintaining a diverse and high-quality solution set. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the stability of the solutions with respect to objective functions, changes in input parameters, and confidence levels. Performance metrics like hypervolume, coverage, generation distance, and ratio of non-dominated individuals (RNI) value are used to assess the effectiveness of NSGA III in managing multi-dimensional transportation problems with multiple objectives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fuzzy environment; Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective multi-item five dimensional transportation problem; NSDE-R; NSGA II; NSGA III","Multimodal transportation; Navigation; Traffic control; Case-studies; Fuzzy environments; Multi objective; Multi-item; Multi-objective multi-item five dimensional transportation problem; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSDE-R; NSGA-II; Transportation problem; Genetic algorithms","","","The first author acknowledges the financial assiatance received from the Ministry of Education (MoE), Goverment of India .","Hitchcock, Frank Lauren, The Distribution of a Product from Several Sources to Numerous Localities, Studies in Applied Mathematics, 20, 1-4, pp. 224-230, (1941); Linear Programming and Extensions, (1963); Proceedings of the Second Symposium in Linear Programming, (1955); Operations Research, (1962); Journal of the Operational Research Society, (1965); Bit, A.

Despite its benefits, the performance and quality characteristics of the coatings produced depend highly on the complex relationship between the coating materials and the process variables. Hybrid reinforcements such as TiC and SiC in metal matrix composites can provide synergistic benefits for components used in extreme environments, like mining, by significantly enhancing wear resistance and mechanical properties. In this work, the effect and many-objective optimisation of the laser processing variables were carried out on TiC/SiC/16MnCr5 multi-track composite coating on A514 steel. By employing hybrid response surface modelling (RSM) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA III), the effect of scanning speed (S), powder feed rate (F), and laser power (P) on coating aspect ratio, dilution, microhardness, and wear resistance were investigated and optimised. The influence of the process variables on aspect ratio, dilution, microhardness, and wear volume loss are in this order, respectively: S > P > F; S > F > P; P > F > S; and P > S > F. The interaction of the process parameters was significant. The wear resistance and microhardness were enhanced due to the partial dissolution of carbides in the matrix. Based on the NSGA III optimisation, the optimal process parameters identified were P = 1550 W, S = 500 mm/min, and F = 7 g/min. The validation experiment revealed a close agreement with the predicted results, with errors of less than 5% for all the objectives.

The primary objective of this research has been to develop traffic light optimization strategies to reduce congestion in areas where tramways or high-speed buses need priority. To this end, a novel approach is presented in this paper as a Genetic Algorithm-based Multi-Objective Traffic Light Optimization (MaMoTLO). It takes into account multiple factors such as minimizing stops, reducing travel and waiting times (private and public), and ensures the synchronizations. This approach is particularly useful in urban areas where multiple tramways intersect with regular traffic, creating potential bottlenecks for private flows. The main innovative aspects are the insertion of structural constraints on flow and queues are junctions, the insertion of penalty constraint for the tramways passage, the capability of working at macroscale of the solution, the validation against real conditions, and the comparison with a large set of solutions. The work presented compares the new optimization strategies with existing state-of-the-art methods, including those based on Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II/III), Simulation of Urban MObility) (SUMO) Actuated solutions, and Webster's formula for traffic light timing. The proposed solutions have been tested using real traffic data from Florence, Italy, and simulated scenarios to measure their effectiveness in reducing congestion and improving traffic flow on Snap4City open platform. The findings indicate that selected MaMoTLO solutions substantially outperform state-of-the-art methods by providing more balanced and efficient traffic light solutions (presenting improvement of 10 % or higher in real conditions), which is crucial for urban areas with high tramway traffic. The proposed optimization improves the flow of vehicular traffic and ensures that public transportation systems like tramways operate smoothly without unnecessary delays.

Smart meter data provide an opportunity for utility providers to address these challenges by implementing demand response management (DRM), which enables customers to reduce consumption and balance load across the grid. For the demand response management in the smart grid, a multi-objective problem (MOP) is formulated considering three objectives, i.e., power scarcity, wastage and load factor. These objectives are computed by the newly proposed load forecasting neural network that precisely predicts upcoming loads on the demand side. The weights of this neural network are optimized using a hybrid learning approach that integrates evolutionary algorithms with Adam optimization. Additionally, the Multi-Objective Programming problem is efficiently addressed through the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in the terms of load forecasting.

Previous research primarily equated actual bike usage with demand and focused on cost-efficiency, which overlooks unmet demand and system-wide optimization. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to optimize FFBS availability at URT stations, particularly during peak hours, through 1) demand prediction, 2) time-based scheduling, 3) priority scheduling strategy, and 4) system-wide optimization. The proposed method incorporates URT ridership as a pivotal feature to enhance the accuracy of bike-sharing demand prediction in URT transfer scenarios. To achieve bike-scheduling benefits, this study introduces a grid-based approach to convert ride data into predictive orders for bike scheduling, measuring time savings across transit modes. Additionally, a prioritization strategy for bike redistribution is designed based on the classification of bus routes around URT stations, ensuring a balanced integration of FFBS and other public transport modes. A multi-objective optimization model is designed to minimize operating costs and maximize passenger time savings, which is addressed with the NSGA-III algorithm. A numerical study using Shenzhen's public transportation data reveals that prioritizing selected stations leads to a 19.4% greater average time savings per order compared to non-priority stations, along with a 7.60% reduction in total passenger travel time. This study more accurately reflects the actual demand, thereby achieving the supply–demand balance in URT-BBS transfers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Free-floating bike-sharing; NSGA-III algorithm; Public transportation integration; Scheduling optimization; Urban rail transit","Bus transportation; Light rail transit; Linear programming; Mass transportation; Transportation routes; Travel time; Urban transportation; Demand prediction; Free-floating bike-sharing; Last mile; NSGA-III algorithm; Optimisations; Public transportation; Public transportation integration; Rail transit stations; Scheduling optimization; Urban rail transit; Bicycles","","","This research was funded in part by the Key R&D Program of Hunan Province (No. 2023GK2014), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52172310 ), and Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2022JJ30763 ).","Public Health, (2024); Ai, Yi, A deep learning approach on short-term spatiotemporal distribution forecasting of dockless bike-sharing system, Neural Computing and Applications, 31, 5, pp. 1665-1677, (2019); Ashraf, Md Tanvir, Impacts of bike sharing program on subway ridership in new york city, Transportation Research Record, 2675, 9, pp. 924-934, (2021); Brinkmann, Jan, Short-term strategies for stochastic inventory routing in bike sharing systems, Transportation Research Procedia, 10, pp. 364-373, (2015); Chang, Peichann (michael), Bike sharing demand prediction using artificial immune system and artificial neural network, Soft Computing, 23, 2, pp. 613-626, (2019); Chen, Bi Yu, Vulnerability analysis for large-scale and congested road networks with demand uncertainty, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 46, 3, pp. 501-516, (2012); Chen, Longbiao, Dynamic cluster-based over-demand prediction in bike sharing systems, pp. 841-852, (2016); Chen, Qingxin, Optimizing bike rebalancing strategies in free-floating bike-sharing systems: An enhanced distributionally robust approach, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 184, (2024); Chen, Qun, Reposition optimization in free-floating bike-sharing system: A case study in Shenzhen City, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 593, (2022); Chiariotti, Federico, A dynamic approach to rebalancing bike-sharing systems, Sensors, 18, 2, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003093906"

Balancing multiple competing objectives under complex constraints so as to provide decision-makers with diverse feasible candidate decision schemes remains an urgent challenge. Based on these requirements, a constrained multi-objective multi-stage weapon-target assignment (CMOMWTA) model is established in this paper. To solve this problem, three constraint-feature-guided multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CFG-MOEAs) are proposed under three typical multi-objective evolutionary frameworks (i.e., NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D) to obtain various high-quality candidate decision schemes. Firstly, a constraint-feature-guided reproduction strategy incorporating crossover, mutation, and repair is developed to handle complex constraints. It extracts common row and column features from different linear constraints to generate the feasible offspring population. Then, a variable-length integer encoding method is adopted to concisely denote the decision schemes. Moreover, a hybrid initialization method incorporating both heuristic methods and random sampling is designed to better guide the population. Systemic experiments are conducted on three CFG-MOEAs to verify their effectiveness. The superior algorithm CFG-NSGA-II among three CFG-MOEAs is compared with two state-of-the-art CMOMWTA algorithms, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CFG-NSGA-II. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","constrained multi-objective optimization problem; constraint handling; Evolutionary algorithms; weapon-target assignment","Constraint handling; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Problem solving; Resource allocation; Complex constraints; Constrained multi-objective optimization problem; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Multi objective; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-stages; NSGA-II; Weapon-target assignment; Constrained optimization","","","This research was supported by the National Science Fund of China under Grant Nos. 62425304 and 62025301, the Basic Science Center Programs of NSFC under Grant No. 62088101, Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project under Grant No. 2021SHZDZX0100, and Shanghai Municipal Commission of Science and Technology Project under Grant No. 19511132101.","Acar, Erdi, A quantum algorithm for solving weapon target assignment problem, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 125, (2023); Zeng, Jie, Multi-Objective Cooperative Salvo Attack Against Group Target, Journal of Systems Science and Complexity, 31, 1, pp. 244-261, (2018); Fan, Guimei, Scenario-based stochastic resource allocation with uncertain probability parameters, Journal of Systems Science and Complexity, 30, 2, pp. 357-377, (2017); Liang, Li, Targets-Attackers-Defenders Game via Pairwise Outcomes, Unmanned Systems, 11, 2, pp. 133-142, (2023); Proceedings of the IEEE Summer Simulation Conference, (1986); Kline, Alexander G., The Weapon-Target Assignment Problem, Computers and Operations Research, 105, pp. 226-236, (2019); Tunga, Harinandan, Efficacy analysis of NSGAII and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) in agent based weapon target assignment (WTA) model, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 16, 3, pp. 1347-1356, (2024); Lu, Yiping, A new exact algorithm for the Weapon-Target Assignment problem, Omega (United Kingdom), 98, (2021); Kline, Alexander G., A heuristic and metaheuristic approach to the static weapon target assignment problem, Journal of Global Optimization, 78, 4, pp. 791-812, (2020); Cai, Huaiping, Survey of the research on dynamic weapon-target assignment problem, Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, 17, 3, pp. 559-565, (2006)","","Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","","","","","","10096124","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000052481"

The proposed ML framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through a case study on wire electric discharge machining (WEDM), focusing on optimizing surface roughness (Ra), cutting speed (CS), and kerf width (KW) for distinct complex shape profiles (plane, angular, curve) of squeeze casted hybrid aluminum metal matrix composite (HAMMC). This highlights the necessity for a framework that goes beyond simply enhancing productivity and quality, aiming for a net-zero in industrial operations. The WEDM performance for the fabricated HAMMC(AA2024/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>/SiC/Si<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>/BN) work pieces is assessed with respect to Ra, CS and KW by varying different WEDM process factors such as spark voltage (S<inf>V</inf>), discharge current (I<inf>D</inf>), wire-electrode feed rate (WE<inf>FR</inf>), pulse or discharge gap (G<inf>D</inf>), and drum speed or wire speed (W<inf>S</inf>). The investigation compares various ML algorithms such as Tree models, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, support vector machine (SVM) models, and artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN models trained for different numbers of hidden layer neurons and learning rate values give the most accurate predictions of the Ra, CS and KW responses. The WEDM process is then modelled as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is solved with two genetic algorithms: the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) outperforms the multi-objective optimization via genetic algorithm (MOGA). In fact, the output values predicted by NSGA-II for (i) Ra (plane, angular, and curve) are, respectively, 18.79 %, 33.17 %, 22.29 %, (ii) CS (plane, angular, and curve) are, respectively 25.78 %, 23.59 %, 12.89 %, and (iii) KW (plane, angular, and curve) are respectively 19.44 %, 26.19 %, 15.56 % better than MOGA predicted values.

This work aims to address the MO-DFJSP, simultaneously minimizing makespan, total tardiness, and carbon emission. Previous research has highlighted the effectiveness of integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods with evolutionary algorithms (EAs). However, existing works often execute EAs and RL independently, with RL influencing only specific parameters. This constrains the algorithms’ overall optimization capabilities. To fully exploit the advantages of RL, this paper presents a co-evolutionary non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) integrated with deep reinforcement learning (CEGA-DRL). In CEGA-DRL, we incorporate an innovative gene operator into the NSGA framework, enabling the RL agent to directly derive excellent gene combinations from a chromosome and feed them back into NSGA-III. This accelerates the learning process of NSGA-III. In addition, we present a dual experience-pool elite backtracking strategy (DEEBS) to offer NSGA-III's high-quality solution as experiences for the RL agent. This, in turn, improves the learning efficiency of the RL agent. The performance of CEGA-DRL is evaluated on the self-constructed MO-DFJSP benchmarks with various transit time, energy consumption, and workshop configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison to the state-of-the-art intelligent optimization algorithms, CEGA-DRL achieves superior results across all the scheduling objectives and exhibits significant advantages in solution convergence and distribution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep reinforcement learning; Energy conservation; Multi-objective distributed flexible job shop scheduling; NSGA-III","Job shop scheduling; Reinforcement learning; Co-evolutionary; Energy; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Multi objective; Multi-objective distributed flexible job shop scheduling; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Reinforcement learning agent; Reinforcement learnings; Deep reinforcement learning","","","This paper was supported by Chengdu Science and Technology Project (No. 2022-YF05-01058-SN ).","de C Bissoli, Dayan C.Castro, Lexicographic optimization-based clustering search metaheuristic for the multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling problem, International Transactions in Operational Research, 28, 5, pp. 2733-2758, (2021); Bozejko, Wojciech, Parallel hybrid metaheuristics for the flexible job shop problem, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 59, 2, pp. 323-333, (2010); Brandimarte, Paolo, Routing and scheduling in a flexible job shop by tabu search, Annals of Operations Research, 41, 3, pp. 157-183, (1993); Cao, Shijie, Inverse model and adaptive neighborhood search based cooperative optimizer for energy-efficient distributed flexible job shop scheduling, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 83, (2023); Chen, Ronghua, A self-learning genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning for flexible job-shop scheduling problem, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 149, (2020); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Grumbach, Felix, A Memetic Algorithm With Reinforcement Learning for Sociotechnical Production Scheduling, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 68760-68775, (2023); Gu, Yifan, An improved memetic algorithm to solve the energy-efficient distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem with transportation and start-stop constraints, Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 20, 12, pp. 21467-21498, (2023); He, Cheng, Accelerating large-scale multiobjective optimization via problem reformulation, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 23, 6, pp. 949-961, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218453269"

Based on the limited charging stations and rated charging/discharging power for the PEVs, the charging/discharging power of the PEVs should comply with the capacity limits and be formulated as the variables of DEED-PEV. To avoid large fluctuations of power loads and guarantee steady operation of the power system, a load smooth function is formulated for the accumulated loads. In addition, the stored potential energies in the upstream reservoir are formulated as the variables of DEED-PEV to regulate the electricity outputs/inputs of the pumped storage power station. The electricity of the power grid can be utilized in a more efficient way. A NSGA-III method based on triangular distribution (NSGA-III-TD) and a constraint handling strategy (CHS) are proposed to tackle this issue. The former updates solutions according to triangular distribution in crossover, and the latter repairs infeasible solutions by a series of specific steps. Experimental results suggest that CHS can tackle the constraints efficiently and NSGA-III-TD can obtain the Pareto sets with relatively large hypervolumes and coverage rates in comparison with the other four MOEAs for four DEED-PEVs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capacity limits; Constraint handling strategy; Dynamic economic emission dispatch; Load smooth function; NSGA-III; Plug-in electric vehicles","Charging stations; Plug-in electric vehicles; State of charge; Capacity limit; Constraint handling strategies; Dynamic economic emission dispatch; Economic-emission dispatch; Load smooth function; NSGA-III; Plug-ins; Pumped-storage power stations; Smooth functions; Triangular distribution; Charge storage","","","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62103239 ).","Ahmed, Ijaz, Neuro-Fuzzy and Networks-Based Data Driven Model for Multi-Charging Scenarios of Plug-in-Electric Vehicles, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 87150-87165, (2023); Basu, M., Dynamic economic emission dispatch using evolutionary programming and fuzzy satisfying method, International Journal of Emerging Electric Power Systems, 8, 4, (2007); Basu, M., Dynamic economic emission dispatch using nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 30, 2, pp. 140-149, (2008); Behera, Soudamini, Dynamic Combined Economic Emission Dispatch integrating Plug-in Electric Vehicles and Renewable Energy Sources, International Journal of Ambient Energy, 43, 1, pp. 4683-4700, (2022); Cao, Jie, A two-stage evolutionary strategy based MOEA/D to multi-objective problems, Expert Systems with Applications, 185, (2021); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Gao, Ruibin, NSGA-III-SD based Fuzzy energy management system optimization for lithium battery/supercapacitor HEV, Applied Soft Computing, 142, (2023); Guerreiro, Andreia P., The Hypervolume Indicator: Computational Problems and Algorithms, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 6, (2022); Hassan, Mohamed H., MSSA-DEED: A Multi-Objective Salp Swarm Algorithm for Solving Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch Problems, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 15, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218352883"

A field test of synchronous excavation and segment assembly TBM (S-TBM) is used as a case study to confirm the proposed method's reliability.

We propose a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that addresses this gap by simultaneously minimizing total distribution costs and carbon emissions while maximizing customer satisfaction, quantified based on the vehicle’s arrival time at the customer location. The rationale for adopting this tri-objective formulation lies in its ability to reflect real-world trade-offs between economic efficiency, environmental performance, and service level, which are often considered in isolation in previous studies. To tackle this complex problem, we develop an improved Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) that incorporates three key enhancements: (1) an integer-encoded initialization method to enhance solution feasibility, (2) a refined selection strategy utilizing crowding distance to maintain population diversity, and (3) an embedded 2-opt local search operator to prevent premature convergence and avoid local optima. Comprehensive validation experiments using Solomon’s benchmark instances and a real-world case demonstrate that the presented algorithm consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization methods across key performance metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness and practical relevance of our approach in advancing energy-efficient, low-emission, and customer-centric urban logistics systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","customer satisfaction; green vehicle routing problem; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; time window","","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 51805152 and 52475528, in part by the Scientific Research Foundation for High-level Talents of Hubei University of Technology under Grant No. GCRC2020009, in part by the Key R&D Program of Hubei Province under Grant No. 2023BEB043, and in part by the Doctoral Scientific Research Foundation of Hubei University of Technology under Grant No. BSQD2022002.","Asghari, Mohammad, Green vehicle routing problem: A state-of-the-art review, International Journal of Production Economics, 231, (2021); Moghdani, Reza, The green vehicle routing problem: A systematic literature review, Journal of Cleaner Production, 279, (2021); Soleimani, Hamed, Collection and distribution of returned-remanufactured products in a vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery considering sustainable and green criteria, Journal of Cleaner Production, 172, pp. 960-970, (2018); Macrina, Giusy, An energy-efficient green-vehicle routing problem with mixed vehicle fleet, partial battery recharging and time windows, European Journal of Operational Research, 276, 3, pp. 971-982, (2019); Sadati, İhsan Ehsan, A hybrid variable neighborhood search approach for the multi-depot green vehicle routing problem, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 149, (2021); Toro O, Eliana M., A multi-objective model for the green capacitated location-routing problem considering environmental impact, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 110, pp. 114-125, (2017); Poonthalir, G., A Fuel Efficient Green Vehicle Routing Problem with varying speed constraint (F-GVRP), Expert Systems with Applications, 100, pp. 131-144, (2018); Long, Jianyu, A hybrid multi-objective genetic local search algorithm for the prize-collecting vehicle routing problem, Information Sciences, 478, pp. 40-61, (2019); Anderluh, Alexandra, Multi-objective optimization of a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with vehicle synchronization and ‘grey zone’ customers arising in urban logistics, European Journal of Operational Research, 289, 3, pp. 940-958, (2021); Ziaei, Zahra, A multi-objective robust optimization approach for green location-routing planning of multi-modal transportation systems under uncertainty, Journal of Cleaner Production, 291, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20738994","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006839640"

This study takes Hancheng City as a case study to develop a water resource optimization allocation model based on economic, social, and ecological benefits, analyzing and predicting the supply and demand of conventional and unconventional water resources in the study area. The model is solved using the NSGA algorithm, and solutions are screened from the Pareto front using the TOPSIS-CCDM two-level decision model, with the RSR method used for comparative verification. The results show that the schemes II-2022-21 (water shortage of 17,802.35 m3/d, economic benefits of 21,019,556.17 yuan, pollutant emissions of 745.92 tons), II-2027-ACS (shortage of 14,098.76 m3/d, economic benefits of 29,401,252.75 yuan, emissions of 712.07 tons), and II-2032-ACS (shortage of 12,709.33 m3/d, economic benefits of 36,660,367.83 yuan, emissions of 700.96 tons) are in line with the water resource allocation planning for Hancheng City before 2035. These schemes not only meet the regional planning requirements but also maximize economic benefits while minimizing water shortages and pollutant emissions. The study finds that NSGA-II has an advantage in selecting more coordinated schemes, while NSGA-III focuses more on the selectivity of specific targets. Although the TOPSIS-CCDM model performs well in comprehensive evaluation, it also exposes limitations such as sensitivity to data fluctuations and high computational complexity. By developing and applying advanced optimization and decision models, this study provides a scientific water resource allocation scheme for Hancheng City, supporting the sustainable management of regional water resources, and offering a reference for future research in addressing data uncertainties and improving computational efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","multi-objective optimization; NSGA algorithm; Pareto solutions; supply–demand balance; TOPSIS-CCDM model; unconventional water","algorithm; optimization; regional planning; resource allocation; water resource; water supply; China; Hancheng; Shaanxi","","","This study was supported by the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi (2021ZDLSF05-09) and Shaanxi Coal Industry Resource Comprehensive Utilization Project (2022SMHK-B-J-32).","Mirdashtvan, Mahsa, Sustainable Water Supply and Demand Management in Semi-arid Regions: Optimizing Water Resources Allocation Based on RCPs Scenarios, Water Resources Management, 35, 15, pp. 5307-5324, (2021); Zhang, Meng, Resource-based cities (RBC): A road to sustainability, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 21, 5, pp. 465-470, (2014); Wang, Saige, Water Resource Utilization Assessment in China Based on the Dynamic Relationship between Economic Growth and Water Use, Water (Switzerland), 16, 10, (2024); Pittock, Jamie Pittockjamie, A review of the risks to shared water resources in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australian Journal of Water Resources, 27, 1, pp. 1-17, (2023); Dong, Shuning, Characteristics of Water Hazards in China’s Coal Mines: A Review, Mine Water and the Environment, 40, 2, pp. 325-333, (2021); Guo, Dandan, Multi-Objective Water Allocation for Wu’an City, Water (Switzerland), 17, 2, (2025); Li, Hong, Resource tax reform and economic structure transition of resource-based economies, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 136, pp. 389-398, (2018); Liu, Xiaomeng, Evaluation and empirical research on the energy efficiency of 20 mining cities in Eastern and Central China, International Journal of Mining Science and Technology, 28, 3, pp. 525-531, (2018); Wang, Dong, Water resource utilization and future supply–demand scenarios in energy cities of semi-arid regions, Scientific Reports, 15, 1, (2025); Ahmed, Syed A., Produced water reuse enabling circularity in oil operations, Desalination and Water Treatment, 263, pp. 60-69, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006761117"

As the count of objective functions rises to four or beyond, the problem’s complexity intensifies considerably, often making it challenging for traditional algorithms to arrive at satisfactory solutions. The non-dominated sorting evolutionary reference point-based (NSGA-III) and the grid-based evolutionary algorithms (GrEA) are two prevalent algorithms for many-objective optimization. These two algorithms preserve population diversity by employing reference point and grid mechanisms, respectively. However, they still have limitations when addressing many-objective optimization problems. Due to the uniform distribution of reference points, the reference point-based methods do not obtain good performance on problems with an irregular Pareto front, while grid-based methods do not achieve good results on problems with a regular Pareto front because of the uneven partition of grids. To address the limitations of reference point-based algorithms and grid-based approaches in tackling both regular and irregular problems, a reference point- and grid-based evolutionary algorithm with entropy is proposed for many-objective optimization, denoted as RGEA, which aims to solve both regular and irregular many-objective optimization problems. Entropy is introduced to measure the shape of the Pareto front of a many-objective optimization problem. In RGEA, a parameter (Formula presented.) is introduced to determine the interval for calculating the entropy value. By comparing the current entropy value with the maximum entropy value, the reference point-based method or the grid-based method can be determined. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, a comprehensive experiment was designed on some popular test suites with 3-to-10 objectives. In addition, RGEA was compared against six algorithms without adaptive technology and six algorithms with adaptive technology. A great number of experimental results were obtained showing that RGEA can obtain good results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","entropy; grid; many-objective optimization; reference point","","","","The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 42271391 and No. 62006214; the Special Project of Hubei Key Research and Development Program under Grant No. 2023BIB015; the Joint Funds of Equipment Pre-Research and Ministry of Education of China under Grant No. 8091B022148; and the Hubei excellent young and middle-aged science and technology innovation team plan project under Grant No. T2021031.","Khare, Vineet R., Performance scaling of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2632, pp. 376-390, (2003); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Li, Bingdong, Many-objective evolutionary algorithms: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 48, 1, (2015); Laumanns, Marco, Combining convergence and diversity in evolutionary multiobjective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 10, 3, pp. 263-282, (2002); Yang, Shengxiang, A grid-based evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 17, 5, pp. 721-736, (2013); He, Zhenan, Fuzzy-based pareto optimality for many-objective evolutionary algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 2, pp. 269-285, (2014); Ikeda, Kokolo, Failure of Pareto-based MOEAs: Does non-dominated really mean near to optimal?, 2, pp. 957-962, (2001); Yuan, Yuan, A New Dominance Relation-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 1, pp. 16-37, (2016); Xiang, Yi, A Vector Angle-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Unconstrained Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 21, 1, pp. 131-152, (2017); Li, Miqing, Shift-based density estimation for pareto-based algorithms in many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 3, pp. 348-365, (2014)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","10994300","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006544387"

Particularly in the Gobi Desert, concrete pavements suffer from conflicting performance requirements—high flexural-to-compressive strength ratio (R<inf>f</inf>/R<inf>c</inf>), low shrinkage, and controlled porosity—with traditional design methods failing to address multi-objective trade-offs. Existing optimization methods have proven insufficient for such complex environments, with conventional approaches addressing only individual parameters or employing subjective weighting techniques that fail to capture the interrelated nature of critical performance indicators. This study develops an integrated optimization framework combining Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) weighting, and VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) decision-making to optimize the mix proportions water–cement ratio (W/C), sand ratio, and an air-entraining agent (AEA) for sustainable pavement concrete. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) analysis via Box–Behnken design revealed distinct parameter dominance: AEA exhibited the strongest non-linear effects on R<inf>f</inf>/R<inf>c</inf> and porosity, while W/C primarily governed shrinkage. NSGA-III generated 73 Pareto-optimal solutions, with CRITIC selecting an optimal mix (W/C = 0.35), sand ratio = 36%, AEA = 0.200%) validated experimentally (R<inf>f</inf>/R<inf>c</inf> = 0.141), shrinkage = 0.0446%, porosity = 2.82%. Microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (SEM/LF-NMR) demonstrated refined pore distribution and enhanced compactness. This framework effectively resolves trade-offs between performance indicators, providing a scientifically robust method for designing durable pavement concrete that reduces shrinkage by 13.0% and porosity by 13.5% compared to conventional mixes, lowering maintenance costs in arid regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; pavement concrete; response surface methodology; VIKOR","Pareto principle; Risk perception; Surface stress; Surface temperature; Air entraining agents; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Pavement concrete; Performance indicators; Response-surface methodology; Sand ratios; Trade off; Višekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje; Concrete pavements","","","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52222806), the Outstanding Youth Science Foundation of Shaanxi province (Grant No. 2022JC-20).","J Mater Poly Sci, (2022); Choi, Sung-yong, A study on the shrinkage control of fiber reinforced concrete pavement, Procedia Engineering, 14, pp. 2815-2822, (2011); Pranav, Shreyas, Alternative materials for wearing course of concrete pavements: A critical review, Construction and Building Materials, 236, (2020); Li, Xiaogang, Materials science: Share corrosion data, Nature, 527, 7579, pp. 441-442, (2015); Zhang, Zhen, Multi-objective optimization, shrinkage and fracture properties of unsaturated polyester resin modified concrete for bridge deck pavement based on system theory, Construction and Building Materials, 443, (2024); Cui, Tong, Optimization and regulation of pavement concrete properties in plateau environment with large daily temperature difference: From mixture design to field application, Construction and Building Materials, 378, (2023); Scc for Submerged Repair of Harbours or Power Plant Dams, (2003); Ma, Lei, Water loss and shrinkage prediction in 3D printed concrete with varying w/c and specimen sizes, Cement and Concrete Composites, 149, (2024); Piasta, Wojciech G., The effect of cement paste volume and w/c ratio on shrinkage strain, water absorption and compressive strength of high performance concrete, Construction and Building Materials, 140, pp. 395-402, (2017); Kondraivendhan, B., Strength and w/c ratio relationship of cement based materials through pore features, Materials Characterization, 122, pp. 124-129, (2016)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004885745"

The findings indicate the following: (1) from 1990 to 2020, economic benefits increased fivefold, whereas the ecosystem service value declined by 6.7%, showing a clear divergence; (2) the overall regional coordination deteriorated, with economic expansion significantly encroaching upon ecological space in certain areas; (3) under the optimization scenario, the balanced development strategy increased economic benefits by 12.3%, enhanced the ecological value by 8.6%, and improved coordination by 15.4%, demonstrating that optimizing land allocation can synergistically enhance both economic and ecological benefits while ensuring the rational use of water resources and ecological security.

In order to expand its application scope and maximize its advantage, it is necessary to propose more advanced mixture design method. This study proposed an intelligent design framework combining machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms for developing epoxy asphalt mixture. First, high-accuracy prediction models of the performance of epoxy asphalt mixture under high and low-temperature environments were established using Extreme Gradient Boosting optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-XGBoost). Then, interpretability analysis, including feature importance and accumulated local effects, was conducted based on these models to identify the key design features of epoxy asphalt mixture and determine their empirical value ranges to achieve satisfactory mixture performance. Next, diversified strategies were determined to meet engineering needs, including high performance, low cost and carbon emissions, as well as a comprehensive strategy that incorporates all these objectives. Subsequently, multi-objective optimization models considering these strategies were established, and the optimal solutions were generated based on the Third Generation of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) and TOPSIS. Finally, the practical feasibility of these solutions was confirmed through laboratory tests. Based on the proposed framework, high-performance, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable epoxy asphalt mixtures can be obtained.

Prior studies focus on 3D-MBSBPP in cases where unloading is not considered. However, as the variety of vehicle types and the number of customers’ cargo increase, it not only reduces the efficiency of cargo loading and unloading but also increases the diversified needs of companies. To address these difficulties, more efficient methods are imperatively required. In this study, we construct a novel model for the multi-drop 3D-MBSBPP, which incorporates three objectives: maximizing vehicle space utilization rate, minimizing vehicle usage costs and spatial blockage index, while considering some practical constraints. Given the high complexity of this model, we propose a novel multi-objective dynamic feedback algorithm to solve it, which consists of three stages. Among them, Stage 1 focuses on optimizing the placement relationship between cargoes with different unloading sequences; Stage 2 dynamically adjusts and optimizes the vehicle types; and Stage 3 further optimizes the quality of the solution. More importantly, the proposed algorithm helps decision makers with the trade-off between multiple objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through comparative experiments on benchmark instances and apply it to solve muti-drop 3D-MBSBPP. The results indicate that based on generating smaller spatial blockage index, the proposed algorithm can improve the average vehicle space utilization rate and reduce the average vehicle usage costs. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm in solving the multi-drop 3D-MBSBPP. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic feedback algorithm; Multi-drop shipments; Multiple objective mixed integer programming model; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm Ⅲ; Spatial corner fitness assessment strategy; Three-dimensional multiple bin-size bin packing problem","Benchmarking; Bins; Mixed-integer linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Assessment strategies; Bin packing problem; Bin size; Dynamic feedback; Dynamic feedback algorithm; Feedback algorithms; Mixed integer programming model; Multi-drop shipment; Multiple objective mixed integer programming model; Multiple-objectives; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ⅲ; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Spatial corner fitness assessment strategy; Three-dimensional multiple bin-size bin packing problem; Integer programming","","","This work was supported by the Key Project of the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [Grant No. 2022\u202F J02053 ].","Gajda, Mikele, An optimization approach for a complex real-life container loading problem, Omega (United Kingdom), 107, (2022); Olsson, Jonas, Automating the planning of container loading for Atlas Copco: Coping with real-life stacking and stability constraints, European Journal of Operational Research, 280, 3, pp. 1018-1034, (2020); Li, Ying, A hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm for the large-scale heterogeneous container loading problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 189, (2022); Bonet Filella, Guillem, Modeling soft unloading constraints in the multi-drop container loading problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 308, 1, pp. 336-352, (2023); Liu, Yi, Dynamic feedback algorithm based on spatial corner fitness for solving the three-dimensional multiple bin-size bin packing problem, Complex and Intelligent Systems, 10, 3, pp. 4055-4081, (2024); Li, Xueping, A hybrid differential evolution algorithm for multiple container loading problem with heterogeneous containers, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 90, pp. 305-313, (2015); Ceschia, Sara, Local search for a multi-drop multi-container loading problem, Journal of Heuristics, 19, 2, pp. 275-294, (2013); Wei, Lijun, A goal-driven prototype column generation strategy for the multiple container loading cost minimization problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 241, 1, pp. 39-49, (2015); Alonso, M.

Considering the rapid reduction of fossil fuels and the rapid trend of environmental pollution by ICEs, researchers tried to provide suitable environmental conditions and engine performance conditions by optimizing control parameters, in addition to reducing fuel consumption and pollutants. Finding the optimal values of control parameters to reduce fuel consumption and emissions simultaneously turns engine calibration into a complex multi-objective optimization problem. Therefore, an artificial intelligence-based strategy to optimize engine performance and emission characteristics was provided in this study by looking at the data of an Otto cycle mono-cylinder combustion engine that operates with two distinct compression rates and numerous ethanol/water combinations. The proposed method has two different phases. Phase 1: Prediction of the output variables i.e. Torque, CO, CO<inf>2</inf>, HC, NO<inf>x</inf> using a random forest algorithm to test the accuracy of function. Phase 2: Solving the multi-objective optimization problem (maximizing torque and minimizing emissions) using the NSGA-II algorithm. In this combined approach, the Random Forest model operates within the NSGA-II algorithm, producing the required values for bi-objective optimization with an R2 accuracy of 0.99. The results showed that the best solutions of Torque from the Pareto front in the combination of Torque with CO<inf>2</inf>, CO, HC, and NO<inf>x</inf> emissions are equal to 12.29, 12.14, 12.24, and 12.11 (Nm), respectively. Also, the optimal values of emissions in these combinations were equal to 8.81, 0.39, 12.56 and 46.43 (ppm), respectively. Finally, a five-objective solution is proposed for five outputs using the NSGA-III algorithm and the best pareto-optimal solutions are presented. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emission; Internal Combustion Engine; Machine Learning; Multi-objective optimization; Otto Cycle; Random Forest-NSGA-II","Combustion equipment; Combustion engines; Emission; Engine emission; Engine performance; Internal combustion; Machine-learning; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-II; Random forest-NSGA-II; Random forests; Engine cylinders","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Special Projects in Key Areas of Colleges and Universities in Guangdong Province (No. 2022ZDZX4062); the Project of Guangdong University Engineering Technology Center (No. 2022GCZX013); the Research Center for Collaboration Innovation of Airport Economy (RCCIAE) in South China Business College of Guangdong University of Foreign Studies.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Special Projects in Key Areas of Colleges and Universities in Guangdong Province (No. 2022ZDZX4062); the Project of Guangdong University Engineering Technology Center (No. 2022GCZX013); the Research Center for Collaboration Innovation of Airport Economy (RCCIAE) in South China Business College of Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Special project in key fields of colleges and universities in Guangdong province (No. 2024ZDZX1041); Key Research Project of Guangdong Baiyun College (No. 2022BYKYZ02); Key Research Platform of Guangdong Province (No. 2022GCZX009); School level scientific research and innovation team project \u201Cvisual media intelligent analysis and content security team.","Ridhuan, Amir, A Review of Comparative Study on The Effect of Hydroxyl Gas in Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) On Engine Performance and Exhaust Emission, Journal of Advanced Research in Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Sciences, 87, 2, pp. 1-16, (2021); Arbab, M.

This research aims to characterize the impact of shrouds on gear churning losses through a combined data- and physics-driven approach and to develop a mathematical model suitable for complex mechanical systems. Initially, a physical model for churning losses in bare gears was established by simplifying the Navier-Stokes equations, providing a foundation for modeling under shrouded conditions. Subsequently, a mathematical model, the churning loss coefficients model (CLCM), was developed using least squares fitting. This model incorporates seven coefficients to be determined. After numerous tries, the presented CLCM adapts to multiple shroud configurations considering the evolution of the gear speeds. In addition, a data-driven optimization framework for the CLCM was designed. It integrates a backpropagation neural network, optimized by particle swarm optimization, with third-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms. This framework, which integrates the capabilities of accurate description of multiphase physical processes and comprehensive multi-objective search, enables the comprehensive optimization of the primary coefficients in the CLCM across multiple speeds. Finally, the generalization capability of the optimized CLCM was validated on a complex planetary gear system, demonstrating a prediction accuracy exceeding 93 %. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of more efficient gearboxes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Churning losses modeling; NSGA-Ⅲ; PSO-BP neural network; Shrouded gears; Splash lubrication","Epicyclic gears; Least squares approximations; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); BP neural networks; Churning loss; Churning loss modeling; Loss coefficients; Loss model; Lubrication /; NSGA-ⅲ; PSO-BP neural network; Shrouded gear; Splash lubrication; Navier Stokes equations","","","This work was supported by Key Scientific and Technological Projects of Jilin Province (20220201026GX, 20220401083YY); Science and Technology Research Program of Jilin Provincial Education Department (JJKH20200037KJ); National Natural Science Foundation, China (5240051771); Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program (BX20240139); and Jilin Province Doctoral Student Research and Innovation Capacity Enhancement Project (2024KC079).","Yu, Yihao, Dynamic modelling of gearbox with multiple localized defects and its coupled vibration analysis, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 180, (2022); Shi, Ying, Analysis of bulk temperature field and flash temperature for locomotive traction gear, Applied Thermal Engineering, 99, pp. 528-536, (2016); Ouyang, Tiancheng, CFD-vibration coupled model for predicting cavitation in gear transmissions, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 225, (2022); Liu, Heli, Effects of lubrication on gear performance: A review, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 145, (2020); Hu, Xiaozhou, Influence of dynamic attitudes on oil supply for bearings and churning power losses in a splash lubricated spiral bevel gearbox, Tribology International, 159, (2021); Legrady, Benjamin, Prediction of churning losses in an industrial gear box with spiral bevel gears using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic method, Forschung im Ingenieurwesen/Engineering Research, 86, 3, pp. 379-388, (2022); Hu, Xiaozhou, Churning power losses of a gearbox with spiral bevel geared transmission, Tribology International, 129, pp. 398-406, (2019); Neurouth, Adrien, Experimental Investigations to Use Splash Lubrication for High-Speed Gears, Journal of Tribology, 139, 6, (2017); Chen, Shengwei, Influence of Relative Position of Gears and Casing Wall Shape of Gear Box on Churning Loss under Splash Lubrication Condition—Some New Ideas, Tribology Transactions, 59, 6, pp. 993-1004, (2016); Hu, Shuai, Numerical study on the churning power loss of spiral bevel gears at splash lubrication system, Lubrication Science, 36, 4, pp. 259-276, (2024)","","Academic Press","","","","","","10961216; 08883270","","MSSPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219094535"

Solving this problem is of paramount importance if society is to meet ambitious net zero goals. The problem is solved by identifying an optimal arrangement of individual turbines such that all objectives are optimised. However, a single solution does not exist due to the inherent conflict between objectives, and a set of solutions must be identified. As well as the challenge in generating optimal solution sets, there exists a decision support task if the solutions are to be effectively presented to a decision maker. This study focuses on six key objectives: wind farm efficiency, annual energy production, electric cable length, number of wind turbines, levelised cost of energy, and total area. Two evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II and NSGA-III, were employed to explore the solution space efficiently. Performance evaluation was performed using spacing, generational distance, and hypervolume metrics. The aforementioned algorithms and metrics were applied to three wind farm layouts: a discrete layout and two continuous layouts. The NSGA-III algorithm was shown to perform better than its predecessor (NSGA-II). The difference was small, albeit significant. Previous works (e.g., Rodrigues et al. (2016); Mytilinou and Kolios (2017)) in which many-objective optimisations were discussed provided little insight into the visualisation and interpretation of the results. While the mentioned work used parallel coordinate plots, this work provides a deeper insight by presenting the results via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) plots. The best solution, containing 6188 wind farm layouts, was found by the NSGA-III algorithm on a continuous wind farm layout with repair mechanism.

Automatic assembly welding line is the ideal choice for modern mass production. Existing research primarily focuses on the limited coupling of sub-problems for simple production line. This paper emphasizes the integrated optimization of complex coupling problems of multi-station multi-robot production line. Highly coupled sub-problems such as robot allocation among stations, task allocation among stations, and welding sequence planning are integrated optimized, while meeting a large number of production line composition and parts assembly constraints. At the same time, the robot jumping stations work and man-robot synchronous work are also studied. Large coupling problems with numerous constraints are integrated into a unified and novel multi-station multi-robot allocation and sequence optimization framework without considering collision. Moreover, a set of innovative and complete system optimization model and algorithm are proposed to address the intricate issues. Firstly, the optimization model based on the framework is established considering constraints including robots stations accessibility, robots welding accessibility, welding integrity and process feasibility. Then, a three-layer chromosome is designed to represent the decision space of the coupled integrated optimization problem. To ensure the rationality and validity of chromosomes, a chromosome correction method, which eliminates the robot inaccessibility and welding incompleteness, is devised for population iteration. Meanwhile, a similarity taboo non-dominated sorting rule is proposed and applied to enhance NSGA-III, resulting in the STNSGA-III algorithm. Finally, the cases of actual and mimetic automotive rear floor welding tasks are studied to verify the effectiveness of the STNSGA-III. Compared with three state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and the artificial optimization result, the comprehensive performance of STNSGA-III results is superior to the comparison algorithms, which shows the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model and algorithm for optimizing the high-coupling assembly welding line. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly welding line; Industrial robot; Multi-objective optimization; Scheduling and allocation; Welding sequence planning","Industrial robots; Multiobjective optimization; Multipurpose robots; Robot programming; Robotic assembly; Welding shops; Assembly welding line; Integrated optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Multi-stations; Multirobots; Scheduling and allocation; Sequence planning; Welding line; Welding sequence planning; Welding sequences; Automotive industry","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61973120 and Grant 62076095.","A°blad, Edvin, Intersection-Free Geometrical Partitioning of Multirobot Stations for Cycle Time Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 15, 2, pp. 842-851, (2018); A°blad, Edvin, Spatial-Temporal Load Balancing and Coordination of Multi-Robot Stations, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 20, 4, pp. 2203-2214, (2023); Bukata, Libor, Energy Optimization of Robotic Cells, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 13, 1, pp. 92-102, (2017); Cao, Yue, Human-robot collaborative assembly and welding: A review and analysis of the state of the art, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 131, pp. 1388-1403, (2024); Casalino, Andrea, Optimal Scheduling of Human-Robot Collaborative Assembly Operations With Time Petri Nets, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 18, 1, (2021); Chen, Xinye, A distributed method for dynamic multi-robot task allocation problems with critical time constraints, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 118, pp. 31-46, (2019); Chuang, Liyeh, Improved binary particle swarm optimization using catfish effect for feature selection, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 10, pp. 12699-12707, (2011); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Elango, Murugappan, Balancing task allocation in multi-robot systems using K-means clustering and auction based mechanisms, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 6, pp. 6486-6491, (2011); Eswaran, M., Optimal layout planning for human robot collaborative assembly systems and visualization through immersive technologies, Expert Systems with Applications, 241, (2024)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213078481"

It deals with minimum-vector-angle principle in associate operator for unconstrained test problems. In this article, θ-NSGA-III is extended to handle constrained optimization problems and its practical applications. This is achieved by incorporating constraint-domination scheme based on threshold concept and using blend crossover (BLX-α) operator in the original algorithmic model of unconstrained θ-NSGA-III. The proposed study puts forward two new cases of constrained DTLZ test problems which are scalable to different number of objectives and decision variables.

The model is solved using an improved integer-coded NSGA-III algorithm, which includes four mechanisms: heuristic population initialization, infeasible solution optimization and repair, a weight-matrix-based crossover operator, a multi-column exchange mutation operator, and Pareto simulated annealing.

The implementation of pre-optimized speed profiles significantly reduces the energy consumption while improving key operational performance metrics, such as ride comfort, punctuality, and safety. This study introduces a novel multi-objective optimization method that optimizes the speed profile in scenarios in which railway catenary maintenance vehicles are performing operations on line sections. Initially, a multi-objective optimization model is developed based on a four-stage operational strategy. Subsequently, the enhanced selection strategy of the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (ESS-NSGA-III) algorithm is proposed to refine the mating and environmental selection processes. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the Huoqiu-Caomiao section of the Fuyang-Lu’an Railway in China. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the ESS-NSGA-III algorithm outperforms NSGA-III and NSGA-II in terms of the diversity and convergence of the solution set. Specifically, the Hypervolume (HV) index improves by 0.77% and 4.12% compared to NSGA-III and NSGA-II, respectively. Moreover, the results highlight the advantages of the proposed method based on a comparison of three alternative operational strategies. Compared to the minimum running time strategy, the punctual and delayed strategies achieve energy consumption reductions of 29.51% and 52.86%, respectively.

This paper proposes a novel multi-objective optimization framework for IES operation, incorporating demand response (DR), a comprehensive set of components, and innovative techniques to reduce computational complexity. The proposed framework minimizes total losses, cost, and emissions while meeting energy demands, offering significant advantages in terms of sustainability and cost reduction. The optimization model is implemented using steady-state energy analysis and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) heuristic optimization, while uncertainty analysis and scenario reduction techniques enhance computational efficiency. To further reduce the computational burden, the proposed framework incorporates a novel clustering strategy that effectively reduces the number of scenarios from 1000 to 30. This innovation significantly improves the computational efficiency of the proposed framework, making it more practical for real-world applications. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated against multi-objective seagull optimization algorithm (MOSOA)- and general algebraic modeling system (GAMS)-based methods, demonstrating its superior performance in various scenarios. The improved management system, enabled by the proposed algorithms, facilitates informed operational decisions, enhancing the system’s installed capacity and overall flexibility. This optimization framework paves the way for more efficient and sustainable operation of integrated PV/wind energy systems. Reducing gas and heat network losses, considering both electric and thermal load response, simultaneously utilizing electricity, gas, and heat storage devices, and introducing a new clustering strategy to reduce scenarios are the specific innovations that are mentioned in this paper. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","clustering algorithm; hub management; integrated energy systems; losses reduction; many-objective function; uncertainty","algorithm; energy storage; innovation; optimization; stochasticity; sustainability; uncertainty analysis","","","","Li, Yang, Optimal scheduling of integrated demand response-enabled integrated energy systems with uncertain renewable generations: A Stackelberg game approach, Energy Conversion and Management, 235, (2021); Chen, Yang, Optimal operation for integrated electricity-heat system with improved heat pump and storage model to enhance local energy utilization, Energies, 13, 24, (2020); Int J Smart Grid Clean Energy, (2020); Wu, Haotian, Optimal energy management for microgrids considering uncertainties in renewable energy generation and load demand, Processes, 8, 9, (2020); Lv, Jiawei, Optimal day-Ahead operation of user-level integrated energy system considering dynamic behaviour of heat loads and customers' heat satisfaction, IET Smart Grid, 2, 3, pp. 320-326, (2019); Duan, Jiangdong, Flexible dispatch for integrated power and gas systems considering power-to-gas and demand response, Energies, 14, 17, (2021); Mohammadi, Mohammad Masoudi, Optimal management of energy hubs and smart energy hubs – A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 89, pp. 33-50, (2018); Naderi, Ehsan, State-of-the-art of optimal active and reactive power flow: A comprehensive review from various standpoints, Processes, 9, 8, (2021); Csee Journal of Power and Energy Systems, (2018); Jin, Xiaolong, Optimal day-ahead scheduling of integrated urban energy systems, Applied Energy, 180, pp. 1-13, (2016)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002310047"

The propagation of radio waves in areas with known three-dimensional (3D) terrain differs significantly from that in free space. However, existing radar deployment optimization methods often rely on simplistic propagation models that do not accurately capture the variations in coverage at different heights. Therefore, the parabolic equation model (PEM) is first introduced to radar network deployment considering terrain constraints. After obtaining coverage results for different altitude layers, the Layered Effective Coverage Rate (LECR) is proposed as our optimization objective. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is employed to address this multi-objective optimization problem.

To this end, this study analyzed the production processes of two biodegradable plastics: polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT). Based on this analysis, economic, technical, and environmental improvement indicators were constructed, and an optimization model with the three objectives of profit, carbon emission cost, and process risk was established. In this study, we embedded the improved NSGA-III algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solution set. We also proposed the entropy-weighted efficiency index (EWEI) for the analysis of transport advantages based on the distribution of biodegradable plastics production, road density, and regional prices. With a production line capacity of 10,000 tons and an 8% discount rate, the 10-year return of PBAT products was 7,039,931.23 yuan higher than that of PLA products. The profit of PBAT products was 488.92 yuan higher than that of PLA products per ton of production. However, PBAT products exhibited higher carbon-emission cost and process risk than PLA products, especially process risk, by 0.11%. The East China region has obvious geographical advantages, but the Southwest region is constrained by limitations in production capacity and the presence of mountainous terrain. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize China’s overall industrial layout of biodegradable plastics, strengthen the profit acquisition of biodegradable plastics, support the sustainable promotion of the biodegradable plastics market, and effectively minimize the environmental pollution caused by traditional plastics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","biodegradable plastics; economic assessment; entropy-weighted efficiency index; NSGA-III algorithm; white pollution","algorithm; biodegradation; carbon emission; economic analysis; maximum entropy analysis; optimization; plastic; pollutant source; production system; China","","","This research was funded by the (National Key Research and Development Program of China) grant number (2022YFC3901805).

However, surface issues and the efficiency of post-processing AM components are still multiple challenges to fulfilling industrial application requirements. This work aims to develop machine learning models based on the Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and advanced Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III method (NSGA-III) to improve the surface quality of AM products and the efficient post-processing. To achieve this, statistical analysis and a new understanding based on the interaction of the Electron beam melting (EBM) raster path and the cutting tool are proposed to detail the influence of turning parameters, tool types, and their interaction on turning performance: Surface finish, tool wear, and cutting forces during turning of cylindrical γ-TiAl specimens. After that, an artificial intelligence system based on ANFIS and advanced NSGA-III method was developed for monitoring, predicting, and optimizing the post-processing parameters. The results reveal that the cutting conditions and tool types significantly affect the turning performance. This study demonstrated that the ANFIS models could provide a more precise and dependable estimation model for monitoring and predicting flank and rake wear, surface quality, and cutting forces with fewer errors, 0.863%, 0.53%, 1.06%, 0.552%, 1.121%, and 0.6428%, respectively, compared with measured experiments. Finally, the developed intelligent method achieved the optimal turning conditions to enhance surface quality, reduce cutting forces, and reduce tool wear of printed γ-TiAl. Henceforth, intelligent systems can be used to develop innovative systems that combine AM with post-processing technology to monitor post-processing performance and meet industry 4.0 requirements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additive manufacturing technologies; ANFIS, NSGA-III method; Artificial intelligence; Post-processing performance; Statistical analysis","Electron beam cutting; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III method method; Additive manufacturing technology; Cutting forces; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Post-processing; Post-processing performance; Processing performance; Turning performance; Smart manufacturing","","","This work was supported by Researchers Supporting Project number (RSPD2025R702), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Baudana, Giorgio, Titanium aluminides for aerospace and automotive applications processed by Electron Beam Melting: Contribution of Politecnico di Torino, Metal Powder Report, 71, 3, pp. 193-199, (2016); Boyer, Rodney R., An overview on the use of titanium in the aerospace industry, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 213, 1-2, pp. 103-114, (1996); Dimiduk, Dennis M., Gamma titanium aluminide alloys - An assessment within the competition of aerospace structural materials, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 263, 2, pp. 281-288, (1999); Harding, Richard A., Development of a turbulence-free casting technique for titanium aluminides, Intermetallics, 19, 6, pp. 805-813, (2011); DebRoy, Tarasankar A., Additive manufacturing of metallic components – Process, structure and properties, Progress in Materials Science, 92, pp. 112-224, (2018); Understanding Additive Manufacturing, (2012); Murr, Lawrence Eugene, Metal Fabrication by Additive Manufacturing Using Laser and Electron Beam Melting Technologies, Journal of Materials Science and Technology, 28, 1, pp. 1-14, (2012); Kumar, Nilesh, Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing – A revolutionary method in additive manufacturing, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 285, (2022); Chung, Philip, Rapid and low-cost prototyping of medical devices using 3D printed molds for liquid injection molding, Journal of Visualized Experiments, 88, (2014); Ogunkunle, Oyetola, A review of global current scenario of biodiesel adoption and combustion in vehicular diesel engines, Energy Reports, 5, pp. 1560-1579, (2019)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333015; 02683768","","IJATE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001635358"

This study conducted a field experiment on water–fertilizer coupling in summer maize, with three irrigation levels (60%θ<inf>f</inf>, 70%θ<inf>f</inf>, 80%θ<inf>f</inf>, with θ<inf>f</inf> representing field capacity) and four nitrogen application levels (0, 180, 270, 360 kg/ha). It analyzed variations in yield, partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer (PFP<inf>N</inf>), and the soil CO<inf>2</inf> emission flux across different water–nitrogen combinations, establishing a multi-vector optimization model. NSGA-III (non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) was utilized to determine the most effective combination of water and nitrogen. The results indicated that maize yield initially increases and then declines as irrigation and nitrogen levels rise. PFP<inf>N</inf> showed a decreasing trend, and its decline gradually decreased with increasing irrigation levels, suggesting that water can alleviate nitrogen stress to some extent. Soil carbon dioxide exhalation intensity increased with both irrigation and nitrogen levels. The NSGA-III optimization revealed that the optimal water–nitrogen ratio is 1086.28 m3/ha for irrigation and 265.79 kg/ha for nitrogen. Compared with the best water–nitrogen combination (W2N3) from the experiment, this optimized scheme showed no significant difference in irrigation volume, yield, or soil CO<inf>2</inf> emission flux while increasing PFP<inf>N</inf> by 13.46% and saving 1.56% of nitrogen fertilizer.

Torsional bending deformation caused by residual stresses from multi-axis machining is one of the major factors contributing to excessive dimensional errors in blisk blade manufacturing. However, few studies have focused on predicting the residual stress profile in multi-axis milling of the superalloy GH4169G. Therefore, in this paper, an empirical model was established to predict the residual stress profile in multi-axis milling of the superalloy GH4169G. First, 36 sets of multi-axis milling experiments were conducted. Then, the residual stress profile was fitted using the Exponential Decay Cosine (EDC) function and the Firefly algorithm (FA) based on the experiments. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to establish the mapping relationship between the process parameters and the coefficients of the EDC function. In addition, the effects of process parameters including spindle speed, feed per tooth and tilt inclination angle on surface residual stress, maximum compressive residual stress and residual stress depth were investigated. Finally, the NSGA-III algorithm was used to obtain the recommended process parameters for multi-axis milling of the superalloy GH4169G blades. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Empirical model; GH4169G; Multi-axis milling; Residual stress","Aircraft engine manufacture; Gas turbines; Aero-engine; Cosine functions; Empirical model; Exponential decays; Gh4169g; Multi-axis machining; Multi-axis milling; Process parameters; Residual stress profiles; Torsional bending; Milling (machining)","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075451, 52375465), the Science Center for Gas Turbine Project (Grant No. P2022-B-IV-012\u2013001), the National Science and Technology Major Project of China (Grant No. J2019-VII-0001\u20130141), and the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Program No.2024JC-YBMS-288).","Jia, Dan, Dynamic recrystallization behavior of GH4169G alloy during hot compressive deformation, Journal of Materials Science and Technology, 35, 9, pp. 1851-1859, (2019); Li, Zhenrong, Microstructure and creep property of isothermal forging GH4169G superalloy, High Temperature Materials and Processes, 33, 5, pp. 447-451, (2014); Song, Wenyuan, The Residual Stress and Deformation Control of TC4 Thin-Walled Outer Ring Components by Ultrasonic Regulation, Machines, 10, 8, (2022); Guo, Jiang, Recent progress of residual stress measurement methods: A review, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 34, 2, pp. 54-78, (2021); Zhou, Jinhua, Determining residual stress profile induced by end milling from measured thin plate deformation, Thin-Walled Structures, 200, (2024); Liu, Yang, Investigation on residual stress evolution in nickel-based alloy affected by multiple cutting operations, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 68, pp. 818-833, (2021); Ullah, Irfan, Numerical and experimental investigation on thermo-mechanically induced residual stress in high-speed milling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 76, pp. 575-587, (2022); Wang, Zongyuan, Predicting Surface Residual Stress for Multi-Axis Milling of Ti-6Al-4V Titanium Alloy in Combined Simulation and Experiments, Materials, 15, 18, (2022); Jiang, Xiaohui, Modeling the superposition of residual stresses induced by cutting force and heat during the milling of thin-walled parts, Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 68, pp. 356-370, (2021); Liang, Xiaoliang, Prediction of residual stress with multi-physics model for orthogonal cutting Ti-6Al-4V under various tool wear morphologies, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 288, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333015; 02683768","","IJATE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000381475"

This paper focuses on the efficient task allocation method for the search and rescue scenario with complex timing and resource constraints. First, the considered scenario is formulated, and a hybrid task allocation method considering complex constraints (HTACC) is proposed by integrating decentralized and distributed algorithm. Specifically, a constraint rule is designed to non-dominated sort all unallocated tasks. And, based on the resource constraints and timing constraints in a distributed manner, a bidding strategy is proposed for each UAV to bid for current task. On this basis, the centralized commander investigates an improved NSGA-III to select a UAV alliance that fulfills the constraints based on the received bids to cooperatively complete the task. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HTACC method are verified through experimental simulations. The results show that HTACC can obtain a better Pareto frontier compared to other algorithms. In addition, HTACC can obtain task schedules within 24.25 s, and the average resource utilization rate is as high as 47.72% in a large-scale scenario of 45 tasks with 100 UAVs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heuristic algorithm; Multi-UAV system; NSGA-III; Task allocation","Air cushion vehicles; Helicopter rescue services; Optimization; Resource allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Allocation methods; Bidding strategy; Complex constraints; Heuristics algorithm; Hybrid tasks; Multi UAV; Multi-UAV system; NSGA-III; Task allocation; UAV systems; Heuristic algorithms","","","","Morshed Alam, Muhammad, Joint Optimization of Trajectory Control, Task Offloading, and Resource Allocation in Air-Ground Integrated Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 11, 13, pp. 24273-24288, (2024); An, Xing, Multi-Robot Systems and Cooperative Object Transport: Communications, Platforms, and Challenges, IEEE Open Journal of the Computer Society, 4, pp. 23-36, (2023); Antonyshyn, Luka, Multiple Mobile Robot Task and Motion Planning: A Survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 10, (2023); Baburao, D., Load balancing in the fog nodes using particle swarm optimization-based enhanced dynamic resource allocation method, Applied Nanoscience (Switzerland), 13, 2, pp. 1045-1054, (2023); Bai, Xiaoshan, Group-Based Distributed Auction Algorithms for Multi-Robot Task Assignment, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 20, 2, pp. 1292-1303, (2023); Cao, Pan, Computational Intelligence Algorithms for UAV Swarm Networking and Collaboration: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Directions, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 26, 4, pp. 2684-2728, (2024); IEEE Robot Autom Lett, (2023); Chakraa, Hamza, Optimization techniques for Multi-Robot Task Allocation problems: Review on the state-of-the-art, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 168, (2023); Chen, Lizhi, An efficient multi-objective ant colony optimization for task allocation of heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles, Journal of Computational Science, 58, (2022); Choudhury, Shushman, Dynamic multi-robot task allocation under uncertainty and temporal constraints, Autonomous Robots, 46, 1, pp. 231-247, (2022)","","Springer","","","","","","15730484; 09208542","","JOSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218641320"

This task becomes more serious when classes containing fewer instances are located in overlapping regions. Several approaches have been proposed through the literature to deal with these two issues such as the use of decomposition, the design of ensembles, the employment of misclassification costs, and the development of ad-hoc strategies. Despite these efforts, the number of existing works dealing with the imbalance in multi-class data is much reduced compared to the case of binary classification. Moreover, existing approaches still suffer from many limits. These limitations include difficulties in handling imbalances across multiple classes, challenges in adapting sampling techniques, limitations of certain classifiers, the need for specialized evaluation metrics, the complexity of data representation, and increased computational costs. Motivated by these observations, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary induction approach that evolves a population of NLM-DTs (Non-Linear Multivariate Decision Trees) using the θ-NSGA-III (θ-Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III) as a search engine. The resulting algorithm is termed EMO-NLM-DT (Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization of NLM-DTs) and is designed to optimize the construction of NLM-DTs for imbalanced multi-class data classification by simultaneously maximizing both the Macro-Average-Precision and the Macro-Average-Recall as two possibly conflicting objectives. The choice of these two measures as objective functions is motivated by a recent study on the appropriateness of performance metrics for imbalanced data classification, which suggests that the mAURPC (mean Area Under Recall Precision Curve) satisfies all necessary conditions for imbalanced multi-class classification. Moreover, the NLM-DT adoption as a baseline classifier to be optimized allows the generation non-linear hyperplanes that are well-adapted to the classes ‘boundaries’ geometrical shapes. The statistical analysis of the comparative experimental results on more than twenty imbalanced multi-class data sets reveals the outperformance of EMO-NLM-DT in building NLM-DTs that are highly effective in classifying imbalanced multi-class data compared to seven relevant and recent state-of-the-art methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Area under precision-recall curve; Genetic-based machine learning; Imbalanced data; Multi-class classification","Adversarial machine learning; Binary trees; Network security; Random forests; Area under precision-recall curve; Data classification; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Evolutionary optimizations; Genetic-based machine learning; Genetics based machine learning; Imbalanced data; Multi-class classification; Multivariate decision tree; Non linear; Decision trees","","","","Abdi, Lida, To combat multi-class imbalanced problems by means of over-sampling and boosting techniques, Soft Computing, 19, 12, pp. 3369-3385, (2015); Abdi, Lida, To Combat Multi-Class Imbalanced Problems by Means of Over-Sampling Techniques, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 28, 1, pp. 238-251, (2016); Agrawal, Astha, SCUT: Multi-class imbalanced data classification using SMOTE and cluster-based undersampling, 1, pp. 226-234, (2015); Alcalá-Fdéz, Jesús, KEEL data-mining software tool: Data set repository, integration of algorithms and experimental analysis framework, Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic and Soft Computing, 17, 2-3, pp. 255-287, (2011); Alshomrani, Ali Saleh, A proposal for evolutionary fuzzy systems using feature weighting: Dealing with overlapping in imbalanced datasets, Knowledge-Based Systems, 73, pp. 1-17, (2015); Anand, Rangachari, Efficient Classification for Multiclass Problems Using Modular Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 6, 1, pp. 117-124, (1995); Porto Basgalupp, Márcio, Evolving decision trees with beam search-based initialization and lexicographic multi-objective evaluation, Information Sciences, 258, pp. 160-181, (2014); Bhowan, Urvesh, Evolving diverse ensembles using genetic programming for classification with unbalanced data, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 17, 3, pp. 368-386, (2013); Bhowmick, Kiran, HECMI: Hybrid ensemble technique for classification of multiclass imbalanced data, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 863, pp. 109-118, (2019); Bot, Martijn C.J., Application of genetic programming to induction of linear classification trees, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1802, pp. 247-258, (2000)","","Springer","","","","","","15729397; 13811231","","JOHEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218147473"

Designing a feasible deviation-correction trajectory becomes an expensive constrained multi-objective optimization problem due to the need for refined modeling of large-depth wellbore stability analysis. There is a pressing need for advanced drilling trajectory planning methods designed to handle robust constraints and to consider refined geological formation modeling, as current surrogate model-assisted optimization algorithms lack efficiency and balance among feasibility, convergence, and diversity. A Gaussian process-assisted Bayesian Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) based on the reference point-based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) is developed to manage the expensive wellbore stability objective. While surrogate models can effectively mitigate the computational expense, they may not adequately satisfy the stringent trajectory planning constraints. To enhance the constraint handling ability, an intricately devised infill criterion, Feasibility-oriented Bi-objective Acquisition Function (FBAF), tends to select promising feasible solutions to infill into the next generation. The deviation-correction trajectory planning simulation experiment was carried out under limited evaluations with real vertical well data. The results of empirical attainment function analysis demonstrate that the proposed FB-NSGA-III reduces the number of evaluations and exhibits superior performance compared to 11 other traditional surrogate-assisted MOEAs, particularly in terms of feasibility. FB-NSGA-III successfully prevents the back-hook by avoiding constraint violations and maintaining curvature within the specified safety and directional drilling tool build-up range. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acquisition function; Drilling trajectory planning; Empirical attainment function; Expensive optimization; Multi-objective optimization; Surrogate modeling","Constraint satisfaction problems; Drilling machines (machine tools); Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Acquisition function; Bi objectives; Deviation corrections; Drilling trajectory planning; Empirical attainment function; Expensive optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Surrogate modeling; Trajectory Planning; Constrained optimization","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 62333019 ]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2023TQ0337 ]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 2023AFB044 ]; Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF [grant number GZC20232478 ]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan); 111 Project [grant number B17040 ].; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank the support of the No. 3 Exploration Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources of Shandong Province, Yantai, China for this project.","Balula, Samuel, Data-driven reference trajectory optimization for precision motion systems, Control Engineering Practice, 144, (2024); Cai, Zhen, Equivalent-input-disturbance-based robust control of drilling trajectory with weight-on-bit uncertainty in directional drilling, ISA Transactions, 127, pp. 370-382, (2022); Cao, Jie, Well path design and optimization using composite cubic bezier curves, SPE Journal, 27, 6, pp. 3254-3270, (2022); Cayeux, Eric, A New Paradigm for Automatic Well Path Generation Using Multidisciplinary Constraints, Proceedings - SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, 2023-October, (2023); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016); Chugh, Tinkle, A Surrogate-Assisted Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Computationally Expensive Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 22, 1, pp. 129-142, (2018); Dong, Peng, Surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization for control parameters of adjacent gearshift process with multiple clutches, Control Engineering Practice, 135, (2023); Dou, Zijun, Multi-objective optimization design of deviation-correction trajectory considering the production loss in shale gas cluster well, Petroleum Science, 19, 6, pp. 2995-3003, (2022); Florkowska, Lucyna, The Application of Numerical Analysis in Determining the State of the Rock Mass Around Directional Wells, Procedia Engineering, 191, pp. 785-794, (2017); Fonseca, Carlos M., On the computation of the empirical attainment function, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6576 LNCS, pp. 106-120, (2011)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09670661","","COEPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214841334"

These include the Backpropagation (BP) Neural Network, Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Tree Ensemble (TE). These methods are used to construct a mapping model that correlates optimization objectives and parameters. The model served as the fitness function in the Adaptive Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (A-NSGA-III). A total of 1000 optimization results generated by the A-NSGA-III were evaluated to determine the final optimization scheme, using a reverse design approach to identify optimal parameters.A comparison of the hydraulic performance before and after optimization revealed minor improvements in the head, efficiency, and shaft power. The radial force decreased by 17.81%, and the axial force decreased by a substantial 98.12%, meeting the set objectives. The significant reduction in axial force was predominantly observed at the balance chamber. Entropy production theory analysis indicated a considerable decrease in the entropy production rate on the impeller's inner wall.Cross-wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analysis showed a significant correlation between the entropy production rate and the energy variation of the axial force. Before optimization, there was a pronounced coherence between the entropy production rate and the resonance period, which was notably reduced after optimization. This method significantly addresses the issue of excessive axial force in the operation of centrifugal pumps without compromising the basic hydraulic performance.

To address these challenges and improve the quality of service for vehicular users, a cloud–edge-end collaboration caching strategy (CACCSC) based on structured task content awareness was proposed in this paper. The dependencies among task fragments were modeled through fuzzy judgment criteria. In addition, a system delay model, an energy consumption model, and an edge server load balancing model were developed, along with a multi-objective optimization model that integrates system delay, energy consumption, and edge server load balancing variance. To solve this multi-objective optimization problem, an adaptive multi-objective optimization algorithm (MDE-NSGA-III) was developed, which combines an enhanced version of the Differential Evolution algorithm with improvements to the NSGA-III algorithm.

This paper introduces an innovative methodology that combines ensemble learning models with hybrid multi-objective optimization heuristic algorithms to optimize leakage impedance deviation, on-load loss, and raw material consumption in power transformers. The stacking ensemble model uses support vector machines, linear regression, decision tree regression, and K-nearest neighbors as base learners, with the extreme learning machine serving as the meta-learner to re-learn outputs from first-level learners. Given the significant impact of hyperparameters on the prediction performance of ensemble learning models, an improved particle swarm optimization method is proposed for effective hyperparameter optimization. To assess the uncertainty of the proposed ensemble learning model, a Kriging surrogate model-based analysis is outlined. Moreover, a powerful multi-objective algorithm that integrates the multi-objective grey wolf optimization (MOGWO) and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA3) is presented for model optimization. This approach demonstrates superior performance compared to mainstream multi-objective optimization algorithms. The effectiveness of this method is further validated through the engineering tests of two real engineering cases. The proposed algorithm can accommodate various design requirements and, under the given constraints, achieve a multi-objective optimization design for power transformers, ensuring optimal performance in different operational scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ensemble learning; finite element method; genetic algorithm; grey wolf optimization; hybrid algorithm; hyperparameter optimization; Kriging; multi-objective optimization; power transformer","","","","The research is supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project under grant 2024ZD0803200, the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. KYCX24_0896), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. B240205008), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51879089), and the Cooperative Innovational Center for Coastal Development and Protection (for the first group, 2011 Plan of China\u2019s Jiangsu Province, grant no.

However, this reduces their efficiency when addressing MaOPs, which are problems that contain more than three objectives; this is because the portion of the Pareto frontier solutions tends to increase exponentially with the number of objectives. This paper aims at overcoming this problem by proposing a new Many-Objective Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (MaOAOA) that incorporates a reference point, niche preservation, and an information feedback mechanism (IFM). They did this in a manner that splits the convergence and the diversity phases in the middle of the cycle. The first phase deals with the convergence using a reference point approach, which aims to move the population towards the true Pareto Front. However, the diversity phase of the MaOAOA uses a niche preserve to the archive truncation method in the population, thus guaranteeing that the population is spread out properly along the actual Pareto front. These stages are mutual; that is, the convergence stage supports the diversity stage, and they are balanced by an (IFM) approach. The experimental results show that MaOAOA outperforms several approaches, including MaOTLBO, NSGA-III, MaOPSO, and MOEA/D-DRW, in terms of GD, IGD, SP, SD, HV, and RT metrics. This can be seen from the MaF1-MaF15 test problems, especially with four, seven, and nine objectives, and five real-world problems that include RWMaOP1 to RWMaOP5.

The nonlinear mapping function relationship between the nine input parameters and the bridge pier vertical and horizontal displacements is established via BO-CatBoost. The key optimization parameters are for interpretability analysis and determined via Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. NSGA-III is established with the goal of minimizing pier displacement. The applicability and validity of the proposed method are tested in a case study of the Wuhan Metro. The key findings of this study include the following. (1) The accuracy of the prediction model obtained by the BO-CatBoost algorithm on the basis of the training and simulation of the measured engineering data is high. On the bridge pier horizontal and vertical displacement test sets, the R2 values are 0.823 and 0.826, the RMSE values are 0.452 and 0.539, and the MAEs are 0.293 and 0.360, respectively. (2) The optimization effect of the two objectives is significant, and the average percentage of improvement stands at 35.54%. When five shield construction parameters are adjusted simultaneously, the optimization effect of the two objectives is the best, and the average improvement percentage is 54.76%. (3) The optimization effect of the developed BO-CatBoost-NSGA-III intelligent algorithm is greater than that of single-objective optimization. Therefore, the intelligent optimization framework proposed in this paper can provide guidance for the optimal control of pier displacement in shield underpass construction engineering. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian optimization; Bridge pier displacement; Categorical boosting; Multiobjective optimization; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Shapley additive explanations; Shield adjacent bridge construction","Adaptive boosting; Bridge decks; Optimal control systems; Pile foundations; Piles; Tunneling (excavation); Bayesian optimization; Bridge constructions; Bridge pier displacement; Categorical boosting; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Shield adjacent bridge construction; Bridge piers","","","","Aela, Peyman, Prediction of crushed numbers and sizes of ballast particles after breakage using machine learning techniques, Construction and Building Materials, 337, (2022); Ayasrah, Mo'men, Influence of cairo metro tunnel excavation on pile deep foundation of the adjacent underground structures: Numerical study, Symmetry, 13, 3, (2021); Bo, Yin, Real-time hard-rock tunnel prediction model for rock mass classification using CatBoost integrated with Sequential Model-Based Optimization, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 124, (2022); Campos Ciro, Guillermo, A NSGA-II and NSGA-III comparison for solving an open shop scheduling problem with resource constraints, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, 12, pp. 1272-1277, (2016); Cao, Liqiang, Movements of ground and existing structures induced by slurry pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (SPB TBM) tunnelling in clay, Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 97, (2020); Cao, Yongcan, An overview of recent progress in the study of distributed multi-agent coordination, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 9, 1, pp. 427-438, (2013); Chen, Bin, Optimization of high-performance concrete mix ratio design using machine learning, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 122, (2023); Chen, Hongyu, Safety evaluation of buildings adjacent to shield construction in karst areas: An improved extension cloud approach, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 124, (2023); Chen, Ruijun, An integrated framework for multi-objective optimization of building performance: Carbon emissions, thermal comfort, and global cost, Journal of Cleaner Production, 359, (2022); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1917, pp. 849-858, (2000)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09521976","","EAAIE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214512501"

Therefore, remanufacturing processing, as the core of remanufacturing, becomes a key step in solving the above problems. However, with the increasing number of failing products and the advent of Industry 5.0, there is a heightened request for remanufacturing in the context of environmental protection. In response to these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel remanufacturing process planning model to address these gaps. Firstly, the failure characteristics of the used parts are extracted by the fault tree method, and the failure characteristics matrix is established by the numerical coding method. This matrix includes both symmetry and asymmetry, thereby reflecting each attribute of each failure feature, and the remanufacturing process is expeditiously generated. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization model is devised, encompassing the factors of time, cost, energy consumption, and carbon emission. This model integrates considerations of failure patterns inherent in used parts and components, alongside the energy consumption and carbon emissions entailed in the remanufacturing process. To address this complex optimization model, an improved teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm amalgamates Pareto and elite retention strategies, complemented by local search techniques, bolstering its efficacy in addressing the complexities of the proposed model. Finally, the validity of the model is demonstrated by means of a single worm gear. The proposed algorithm is compared with NSGA-III, MPSO, and MOGWO to demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm in solving the proposed model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbon footprint; green manufacturing; remanufacturing planning; repair strategies; teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm","","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 52075303 and Foundation of BUCEA under Grant No. GDRC20220803.","Fathollahi-Fard, Amir M., A distributed permutation flow-shop considering sustainability criteria and real-time scheduling, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 39, (2024); Zhang, Xuesong, A chance-constraint programming approach for a disassembly line balancing problem under uncertainty, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 74, pp. 346-366, (2024); Resour Recycl, (2025); Li, Congbo, A modeling approach to analyze variability of remanufacturing process routing, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 10, 1, pp. 86-98, (2013); Tian, Guangdong, Recycling of spent Lithium-ion Batteries: A comprehensive review for identification of main challenges and future research trends, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, 53, (2022); Bs8887 220 Design for Manufacture Assembly Disassembly and End of Life Processing Made Part 220 the Process of Remanufacture Specification, (2010); Yuan, Gang, Multi-objective coupling optimization of electrical cable intelligent production line driven by digital twin, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 86, (2024); Wang, Jun, Energy-aware remanufacturing process planning and scheduling problem using reinforcement learning-based particle swarm optimization algorithm, Journal of Cleaner Production, 476, (2024); Wang, Han, A fault feature characterization based method for remanufacturing process planning optimization, Journal of Cleaner Production, 161, pp. 708-719, (2017); Adel, Amr, Factories of the future in industry 5.0—Softwarization, Servitization, and Industrialization, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 28, (2024)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20738994","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219046579"

The main work of this paper consists of two parts. First, we designed a set of UAV-based pseudolite navigation system (UAV-PNS) architecture based on fixed-wing UAVs. Then, considering the flight cost of the UAV swarm, the optimization of the UAV swarm’s flight path aimed at improving regional navigation performance was studied. In this paper, the fitness functions for UAVs’ flight path optimization are proposed, taking into account the navigation and positioning performance, the aircraft utilization rate of UAVs under flight constraints, and the response speed of the system to the emergency mission. Based on this, an acceptance–rejection mutated non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (ARMNSGA-III) is proposed for the UAVs’ flight path optimization. The research results show that the flight path strongly guarantees navigation service performance with constraints on the operating cost. The ARMNSGA-III proposed in this paper can provide a 44.01% algorithm timeliness improvement compared to the NSGA-III in the flight path optimization, supporting rapid establishment and continuous service of the UAV-PNS in emergency scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","flight path optimization; NSGA-III; pseudolite navigation; UAV","Air navigation; Antenna grounds; Emergency vehicles; Global positioning system; Helicopter services; Linear programming; Acceptance/rejection; Aerial vehicle; Flight path optimization; Navigation performance; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-III; Pseudolite navigation; Pseudolites; System architecture design; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","This research was funded by the Key Laboratory Fund Project for Simulation of Complex Electronic Systems (614201004022210), the Chinese Academy of Sciences Youth Innovation Promotion Association (2022126), the National Key Research and Development Plan (2022YFC2204700), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (1234041).","Morton, Yu Tong Jade, Position, Navigation, and Timing Technologies in the 21st Century: Integrated Satellite Navigation, Sensor Systems, and Civil Applications: Volume 1, 1, pp. 1-1143, (2021); Li, Xin, Performance analysis of indoor pseudolite positioning based on the unscented Kalman filter, GPS Solutions, 23, 3, (2019); Laoudias, Christos, A survey of enabling technologies for network localization, tracking, and navigation, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 20, 4, pp. 3607-3644, (2018); Barnes, Joel B., A positioning technology for classically difficult GNSS environments from Locata, Record - IEEE PLANS, Position Location and Navigation Symposium, 2006, pp. 715-721, (2006); Positioning, (2003); LeMaster, Edward A., A local-area GPS pseudolite-based navigation system for mars rovers, Autonomous Robots, 14, 2-3, pp. 209-224, (2003); Crommelinck, Sophie, Contour detection for UAV-based cadastral mapping, Remote Sensing, 9, 2, (2017); Xiang, Lin, Robust Dynamic Trajectory Optimization for UAV-aided Localization of Ground Target, Proceedings - IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM, pp. 7484-7489, (2023); Amt, John H.R., Flight testing of a pseudolite navigation system on a UAV, 2, pp. 1147-1154, (2007); Proceedings of the 13th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation Ion GPS 2000, (2000)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2504446X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218439290"

However, multimodal transportation driven mainly by fossil fuels may result in significant carbon emissions. In addition, transportation costs, transportation efficiency, and customer demand are also key factors that constrain the development of multimodal transportation. In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a many-objective multimodal transportation route optimization (MTRO) model that simultaneously considers economic cost, carbon emission cost, time cost, and customer satisfaction, and we solve it via the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version III (NSGA-III). Second, to further improve the convergence performance, we introduce a fuzzy decision variable framework to improve the NSGA-III algorithm. This framework can reduce the search range of the optimization algorithm in the decision space and make it converge better.

The algorithm aims to enhance the existing routing methods by offering users the ability to choose their preferred path from a set of optimal paths optimised on multiple objectives. The objectives are optimised using a novel fitness metric that prioritises minimising path length while also maximising access to specific amenities such as pubs, hotels, and charging stations. The developed approach, called Parallel Optimal-route Search (POS), follows a hybrid model using both global parallelisation and island-based approaches. A Loop-Free Path-Composer (LFPC) is described and this genetic operator generates new paths for evaluation and is shown to yield a more diverse set of solutions in contrast to other commonly used approaches, such as Node Based Crossover and Path Mutation (NBCPM). Our approach is validated on highly complex, large-scale real-world road networks, with sizes ranging from 3,000 and 10,000 nodes. We present a systematic study comparing the performance of our proposed LFPC operator against the traditional NBCPM operators. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed POS algorithm in comparison to the well-known Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and III. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid model; Improved crowding distance (ICD); Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) II and III; Parallel genetic algorithm (PGA); Pareto-optimal solutions; Vehicle routing problem (VRP)","Motor transportation; Pareto principle; Routing algorithms; Crowding distance; Hybrid model; Improved crowding distance; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and III; Parallel genetic algorithm; Parallel genetic algorithms; Pareto optimal solutions; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing","","","","Proceedings of Ies Ctr International Symposium, (1999); Kechagiopoulos, Panagiotis N., Solving the Urban Transit Routing Problem using a particle swarm optimization based algorithm, Applied Soft Computing, 21, pp. 654-676, (2014); Zhang, Xin, Optimization of logistics route based on Dijkstra, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences, ICSESS, 2015-November, pp. 313-316, (2015); Rocha, Miguel P., Quality of Service constrained routing optimization using Evolutionary Computation, Applied Soft Computing, 11, 1, pp. 356-364, (2011); Lu, Ting, A genetic algorithm for finding a path subject to two constraints, Applied Soft Computing, 13, 2, pp. 891-898, (2013); Souères, Philippe, Shortest paths synthesis for a car-like robot, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 41, 5, pp. 672-688, (1996); Bui, Xuan Nam, Shortest path synthesis for Dubins non-holonomic robot, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pt 1, pp. 2-7, (1994); Karur, Karthik, A Survey of Path Planning Algorithms for Mobile Robots, Vehicles, 3, 3, pp. 448-468, (2021); SIAM Journal on Computing, (1972); Dijkstra, E.

Two different multi-objective honey badger algorithms (MOHBA-I and MOHBA-II) based on hybrid elitist framework and circular segmentation screening are proposed for the multi-objective problem of task scheduling optimization in cloud computing systems. MOHBA-I and MOHBA-II combine the grid indexing mechanism and decomposition technique, respectively, to select better populations based on elite non-dominated sorting. A circular segmentation screening mechanism was proposed to retain the superior individuals when the regional density is too high to further maintain the diversity of the populations, and attach an external archive to preserve the uniformly diversified Pareto decomposition set. The performance of the proposed algorithms is verified by using test functions. MOHBA-I and MOHBA-II achieve the first and third rankings, respectively, compared to other classical multi-objective algorithms. Solve the cloud computing task scheduling problem using time, load and price cost as metrics, test for different task sizes, and compare MOHBA-I with algorithms such as NSGA-III, MOPSO and MOEA/D in the same experimental environment. When facing a large-scale task, MOHBA-I ranks first in HyperVolume value with 2.4449E−02 for two objectives and 9.2950E−03 for three objectives. The experimental results show that MOHBA-I finds the highest number of solutions with better convergence and coverage, obtaining a satisfactory Pareto front, which can provide more and better choices for decision makers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular segmentation screening; Cloud computing; Grid mechanism; Honey badger algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Non-dominated sorting; Task scheduling","Cloud computing; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Circular segmentation screening; Cloud computing environments; Cloud-computing; Computing system; Grid mechanism; Honey badger algorithm; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated Sorting; Tasks scheduling; Scheduling algorithms","","","This work was supported by the Basic Scientific Research Project of Institution of Higher Learning of Liaoning Province (Grant No. LJ222410146054), and the Postgraduate Education Reform Project of Liaoning Province (Grant No. LNYJG2022137).","Abdel-Basset, Mohamed, Task Scheduling Approach in Cloud Computing Environment Using Hybrid Differential Evolution, Mathematics, 10, 21, (2022); Abdollahzadeh, Benyamin, A multi-objective optimization algorithm for feature selection problems, Engineering with Computers, 38, pp. 1845-1863, (2022); Abdullah, Monir, Integrated MOPSO algorithms for task scheduling in cloud computing, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 36, 2, pp. 1823-1836, (2019); Abualigah, Laith Mohammad Qasim, A novel hybrid antlion optimization algorithm for multi-objective task scheduling problems in cloud computing environments, Cluster Computing, 24, 1, pp. 205-223, (2021); World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, (2024); Almodfer, Rolla, Improving Parameter Estimation of Fuel Cell Using Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm, Frontiers in Energy Research, 10, (2022); Alresheedi, Shayem Saleh, Improved multiobjective salp swarm optimization for virtual machine placement in cloud computing, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 9, 1, (2019); Alshathri, Samah Ibrahim, Quantum Chaotic Honey Badger Algorithm for Feature Selection, Electronics (Switzerland), 11, 21, (2022); Amer, Dina A., Elite learning Harris hawks optimizer for multi-objective task scheduling in cloud computing, Journal of Supercomputing, 78, 2, pp. 2793-2818, (2022); Bezdan, Timea, Multi-objective task scheduling in cloud computing environment by hybridized bat algorithm, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 42, 1, pp. 411-423, (2022)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","15737462; 02692821","","AIRVE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212784237"

By applying ICT in various fields such as the humanities, new types of products and services are created, and new values that help people's lives can be created. AI can be selected as a representative technology in such convergence ICT. However, applying AI technology to actual production requires ensuring data security. Federated learning (FL) can achieve secure sharing of data, where all parties participate in model training locally and upload it to the server for aggregation. The data never leaves the parties involved, thus solving the problems of data privacy and data silos. However, FL faces issues such as high communication cost, imbalanced performance distribution among participants, and low privacy protection. To achieve a balance between model accuracy, communication cost, fairness, and privacy, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization-based FL algorithm (M-FedAvg). The multi-objective optimization problem of maximising the accuracy of the global model, minimising the communication cost, minimising the variance of the accuracy, and minimising the privacy budget is solved by NSGA-III. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed can effectively reduce the communication cost of FL and achieve privacy protection for participants without affecting the accuracy of the global model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","communication cost; differential privacy; federated learning; ICT; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III","Differential privacy; Optimization algorithms; Communication cost; Differential privacies; Global models; Global trends; Information and Communication Technologies; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-III; Privacy protection; Product and services; Federated learning","","","This work was sponsored in part by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2022YFE0114300), and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (No. cstc2021jcyj\u2010msxmX0330).","China Information Security, (2020); Cheng, Ziwen, A Blockchain-Based Dynamic and Fair Federated Learning for IoT Data Sharing of Inferior Networking Conditions, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 14, (2024); Differentially Private Federated Learning A Client Level Perspective, (2017); Application Research of Computers, (2024); Lee, Meeyeon, A convergence data model for medical information related to acute myocardial infarction, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 6, 1, (2016); Liu, Yu, An audio attention computational model based on information entropy of two channels and exponential moving average, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 9, 1, (2019); Communication Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data, (2016); Pokhrel, Shiva Raj, Federated Learning with Blockchain for Autonomous Vehicles: Analysis and Design Challenges, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 68, 8, pp. 4734-4746, (2020); Qolomany, Basheer, Particle Swarm Optimized Federated Learning for Industrial IoT and Smart City Services, Proceedings - IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM, (2020); Salim, Mikail Mohammed, Federated Learning-Enabled Zero-Day DDoS Attack Detection Scheme in Healthcare 4.0, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 14, (2024)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","02664720; 14680394","0896710742","EXSYE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208439288"

It strategically places servers in decentralized areas to reduce bandwidth usage and transmission latency. This paper focuses on the essential initial phase of MEC deployment, focusing on the major challenge of optimizing the placement and allocation of edge servers. Such optimization is central to increasing the benefits of edge computing systems while reducing costs and energy consumption and improving quality of service (QoS). Traditional optimization methods often treat variable categories homogeneously and neglect directional search considerations, thus compromising search efficiency for large-scale problems. To address these issues, our study develops a complex set of methods that combine decision variable classification and elitism to improve the optimization path and lead to a satisfactory solution. This innovative approach pursues two objectives: First, it articulates an objective to minimize energy consumption, incorporating considerations of proportional load balancing, latency reduction, and fair distribution of users across edge servers. Second, this objective is combined with the latency reduction objective, resulting in a dual-topic optimization task. We compare the proposed method with well-known approaches such as non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). Our findings demonstrate a minimum 3.2% reduction in latency in homogeneous server environments and a remarkable 5.02% reduction in heterogeneous server environments. Energy consumption also drops significantly compared to similar benchmarks. Energy consumption has also fallen significantly compared to comparative benchmarks. The application of the non-parametric Friedman test demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method, which ranks highest among state-of-the-art methods and emphasizes statistical precision. Through a detailed technical discussion, the paper substantiates the feasibility and superiority of the proposed optimization method in addressing the complex requirements of edge server placement and allocation within the MEC paradigm. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification of variables; Edge server placement and allocation; Energy efficiency; Latency minimization; Multi-objective optimization","Benchmarking; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Classification of variable; Edge server; Edge server placement and allocation; Energy; Energy-consumption; Latency minimization; Minimisation; Multi-objectives optimization; Server placements; Quality of service","","","","Liu, Wenjing, Performance modeling and advanced exergy analysis for low-energy consumption data center with waste heat recovery, flexible cooling and hydrogen energy, Energy Conversion and Management, 297, (2023); Jabbari, Ghazal, Heterogenous Server Placement for Delay Sensitive Applications in Green Mobile Edge Computing, Wireless Personal Communications, 126, 2, pp. 1301-1319, (2022); Farfan, Javier, Gone with the clouds: Estimating the electricity and water footprint of digital data services in Europe, Energy Conversion and Management, 290, (2023); Tong, Zhao, Stackelberg game-based task offloading and pricing with computing capacity constraint in mobile edge computing, Journal of Systems Architecture, 137, (2023); Oliveira, Franklin Lazaro, Internet of Intelligent Things: A convergence of embedded systems, edge computing and machine learning, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 26, (2024); Zhang, Yaoxue, A survey on emerging computing paradigms for big data, Chinese Journal of Electronics, 26, 1, pp. 1-12, (2017); Pandya, Sharnil Nitin, Federated learning for smart cities: A comprehensive survey, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, 55, (2023); Hou, Peng, Joint hierarchical placement and configuration of edge servers in C-V2X, Ad Hoc Networks, 131, (2022); Mahenge, Michael Pendo John, Energy-efficient task offloading strategy in mobile edge computing for resource-intensive mobile applications, Digital Communications and Networks, 8, 6, pp. 1048-1058, (2022); Ren, Jinke, Latency optimization for resource allocation in mobile-edge computation offloading, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 17, 8, pp. 5506-5519, (2018)","","Springer","","","","","","13867857","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206602693"

First, with the use of the specific tunneling energy, advancing speed and cutter wear as objective functions, a BO-CatBoost prediction model for shield construction parameters and various objectives was constructed, and the key influencing factors were identified via the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Then, a BO-CatBoost-NSGA-III model was developed to obtain Pareto solutions under different scenarios involving the adjustment of the key influencing factors. Finally, adopting the Wuhan Metro as the background, the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of the constructed algorithm were verified. The results indicated that (1) the developed BO-CatBoost algorithm is superior to 9 other algorithms. The R2 values of the proposed approach were 0.976 and 0.901–0.976 on the test set.

To avoid production disruptions caused by robot failures, higher requirements are imposed on the resilience of systems, specifically in terms of resistance, response, and recovery capabilities. In response to this, this paper investigates the resilient scheduling framework for multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop, thereby endowing and enhancing the resilience of the system. Within the resilient scheduling framework, a proactive scheduling method maximizing resistance capability is firstly proposed based on an improved NSGA-III with variable neighborhood search. Secondly, to improve the response and recovery capabilities of the system, a recovery scheduling method is presented. Therein, an adaptive trigger policy based on deep reinforcement learning is introduced to enhance the rapid response capability for disturbances, while the recovery optimization grants the system the ability to recover its performance that has been degraded due to the impact of disturbances. Finally, through simulation experiments and case study, it is verified that the proposed algorithms and framework possess superior performance of multi-objective optimization, which can endow the multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop with resilience to against uncertain robot failures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop; Proactive scheduling; Recovery scheduling; Resilient scheduling framework; Robot failures","Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Machine shop practice; Multiobjective optimization; Multipurpose robots; Recovery; Reinforcement learning; Welding; Flow-shops; Multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop; Multi-stations; Multirobots; Proactive scheduling; Recovery scheduling; Resilient scheduling framework; Response capability; Robot failure; Scheduling frameworks; Deep learning","","","We thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their fruitful comments and suggestions in improving the quality of this paper.

This work focuses on the generation and optimization processes of scheduling plans and conducts safety assessments and resource efficiency analyses of the generated plans. The proposed optimized model is compared with classical MOO algorithms. These algorithms include Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition with Differential Evolution (MOEA/D-DE), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 with Shift-based Density Estimation (SPEA2+SDE), and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III). Based on the experimental results, the proposed optimized model outperforms three classic MOO algorithms across multiple key performance indicators. In terms of Hypervolume, the value achieved by the proposed model is 0.722, indicating that its solution set covers the objective space more effectively, demonstrating stronger diversity and global search capability. Furthermore, on the indicators of Generative Distance and Inverse Generative Distance, the proposed model attains lower values of 0.008 and 0.061, suggesting that the solution set is closer to the optimal front, with higher precision. In addition, the Spacing Metric value of 0.011 further shows that the solution set generated by the proposed model is more evenly distributed in the objective space. It avoids excessive clustering and enhances the uniformity and adaptability of the solutions. This uniformity is critical in practical construction scheduling optimization. This is because, under multiple conflicting objectives, a well-distributed solution set provides decision-makers with more options, enabling a better balance between safety and resource efficiency. Regarding safety assessment, Plan C has a high score of 4.63, indicating that under the optimization of the proposed model, the construction plan can achieve excellent performance in resource utilization and provide better safety guarantees. Similarly, Plan D, which demonstrates the highest resource efficiency, receives an overall score of 4.72, showcasing its outstanding advantages in resource usage and scheduling efficiency. These results validate the proposed model's applicability and flexibility under different constraints and objective functions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","construction scheduling; multi-objective optimization algorithms; resource efficiency; safety assessment","Distribution functions; Inverse problems; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Project management; Scheduling algorithms; Construction scheduling; Differential Evolution; Intelligent constructions; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objective optimization algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization algorithms; Resource efficiencies; Safety assessments; Solutions sets; Genetic algorithms","","","","Yan, Xuzhong, Intelligent monitoring and evaluation for the prefabricated construction schedule, Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 38, 3, pp. 391-407, (2023); J Intell Constr, (2023); Doukari, Omar, The Creation of Construction Schedules in 4D BIM: A Comparison of Conventional and Automated Approaches, Buildings, 12, 8, (2022); Peiris, Prangige Achini Nadeesha, Production scheduling in modular construction: Metaheuristics and future directions, Automation in Construction, 150, (2023); Singh, Akarsth Kumar, Prospects of Integrating BIM and NLP for Automatic Construction Schedule Management, Proceedings of the International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, pp. 238-245, (2023); Wang, Juan, Design of Intelligent Construction System for Assembly Building Based on Improved IoT, Informatica (Slovenia), 48, 10, pp. 103-118, (2024); Chen, Jing, Construction and Application of an Economic Intelligent Decision-Making Platform Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology, Informatica (Slovenia), 48, 9, pp. 89-106, (2024); Li, Li, Dynamic Cost Estimation of Reconstruction Project Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, Informatica (Slovenia), 47, 2, pp. 173-182, (2023); Feng, Jing, Intelligent Engineering Management of Prefabricated Building Based on BIM Technology, Informatica (Slovenia), 46, 3, pp. 411-420, (2022); Wang, Xiaoqiang, Edge Computing Based Multi-Objective Task Scheduling Strategy for UAV with Limited Airborne Resources, Informatica (Slovenia), 48, 2, pp. 255-268, (2024)","","Slovene Society Informatika","","","","","","18543871; 03505596","","INFOF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219686587"

Key contributions include the development of a multi-objective optimisation framework, integration of adversarial game theory, incorporation of dynamic environmental conditions, and generation of Pareto-optimal solutions for strategic defence planning. This research makes four pivotal contributions: (a) the design of a comprehensive multi-objective optimisation framework tailored for UAV strike optimisation, (b) the integration of game-theoretic principles to model adversarial behaviours, (c) the inclusion of dynamic environmental factors to improve solution robustness, and (d) the application of NSGA-III to generate trade-off solutions, equipping decision-makers with diverse strategies to enhance grid resilience.

While traditional approaches rely on stationary data sinks, the use of mobile sinks, like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has shown promise in enhancing data-gathering capabilities. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of trust, leaving the network susceptible to malicious or faulty nodes. To address this issue, we propose a novel trust-aware data-gathering algorithm, Variable Length Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Data Gathering (VLMOWO-DG). Our algorithm simultaneously optimizes energy consumption, delay, and trust while employing mobile sinks to collect data from sensor nodes. By considering trust as a key performance metric, we improve data reliability and security. The VLMOWO-DG algorithm introduces flexibility through variable-length solution representation and application-oriented operators, allowing for efficient exploration of the solution space. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms established benchmarks, NSGA-II and NSGA-III, in terms of domination and hypervolume.

In the literature of test suite optimization, various single-objective and multi-objective optimization approaches have been proposed by researchers and practitioners. Even though the multi-objective optimization approaches have demonstrated effective performance in test case optimization, their performance tends to degrade when the number of objectives exceeds by more than or equal to three. To tackle this issue, recently few approaches have been proposed. Even though these approaches perform well, there is still scope for improvement. In this work, we introduce a Many-objective Differential Evolution Feedback Evolutionary Algorithm (MDEFEA) for the test case optimization problem. In this approach, we exploit the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm and Information Feedback Model (IFM) concept to optimize line coverage (LC), branch coverage (BC), mutation coverage (MC), and multi-criteria coverage (MCC) simultaneously. To assess the performance of the proposed MDEFEA, we evaluated it across 41 complex projects and compared its results with other similar optimization techniques, including NSGA-III, MOPSO, LSMaOA, and MOEA. The findings of the proposed and existing approaches indicate that MDEFEA outperforms the existing approaches in terms of the Mean Coverage Value (MCV) and Worst Coverage Value (WCV) success rates. Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed MDEFEA is an effective method for test case optimization containing more than three criteria. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated software testing; Evolutionary algorithm; Information feedback model; Many-objective optimization; Pareto front; Software testing coverage; Test suite optimization","","","","","Art of Software Testing, (2004); Software Testing and Analysis Process Principles and Techniques, (2007); Barr, Earl T., The oracle problem in software testing: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 41, 5, pp. 507-525, (2015); Chien, Hsinyu, Applying slicing-based testability transformation to improve test data generation with symbolic execution, International Journal of Performability Engineering, 17, 7, pp. 589-599, (2021); Automated Software Testing Introduction Management and Performance, (1999); IEEE Trans Reliab, (2023); 2022 Proceedings of the IEEE ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering 2022; IEEE Access, (2024); J Syst Softw, (2008); IEEE Access, (2020)","","Springer","","","","","","26618907; 2662995X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212789274"

In order to reduce the offloading delay and energy consumption of structured dependency subtasks while balancing the load of edge servers, a subtask dependency structure partitioning strategy was proposed in this paper. This policy categorizes the dependencies between subtasks into two types: serial dependencies and parallel dependencies. Based on these classifications, a popular dependency-aware cooperative caching policy (PACCS) was designed, which considers the fitness of popular subtasks with different server resource sizes. Then, we design a delay model, an energy consumption model, and an edge server load balancing model to achieve a multi-objective optimization that integrates system delay, energy consumption, and edge server load balancing using the improved NSGA-III algorithm (S-NSGA-III). Simulation experiments show that under the same experimental conditions, the integrated cost of the S-NSGA-III adaptive optimization scheme proposed in this paper is 13.0% lower than that of the NSGA-II scheme, 12.2% lower than that of the NSGA-III scheme, and 16.5% lower than that of the PeEA scheme. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cooperative caching policy; Dependent subtasks; Intelligent transportation; Load balancing; NSGA-III","Caching policy; Cooperative caching; Cooperative caching policy; Dependent subtask; Edge server; Intelligent transportation; Intelligent transportation systems; Load-Balancing; NSGA-III; Subtask","","","This paper was supported by the Natural Science Foundation Project of China (62172457), Tianjin Natural Science Foundation Project (22JCZDJC00600), Tianjin Research Innovation Project for Postgraduate Students(2022SKYZ393), and Henan Science and Technology Innovation Talent Project (23HASTIT029).","Zhang, Ziru, MR-DRO: A Fast and Efficient Task Offloading Algorithm in Heterogeneous Edge/Cloud Computing Environments, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 10, 4, pp. 3165-3178, (2023); Liu, Ryanwen Wen, Deep Network-Enabled Haze Visibility Enhancement for Visual IoT-Driven Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 19, 2, pp. 1581-1591, (2023); Chin J Electron, (2023); Babar, Muhammad, An Optimized IoT-Enabled Big Data Analytics Architecture for Edge-Cloud Computing, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 10, 5, pp. 3995-4005, (2023); Dai, Xingxia, Task Co-Offloading for D2D-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing in Industrial Internet of Things, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 19, 1, pp. 480-490, (2023); Wei, Zhiwei, OCVC: An Overlapping-Enabled Cooperative Vehicular Fog Computing Protocol, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 22, 12, pp. 7406-7419, (2023); Lou, Jiong, Startup-Aware Dependent Task Scheduling With Bandwidth Constraints in Edge Computing, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 23, 2, pp. 1586-1600, (2024); Wang, Zhiying, Low-Latency Scheduling Approach for Dependent Tasks in MEC-Enabled 5G Vehicular Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 11, 4, pp. 6278-6289, (2024); Chen, Xing, Real-Time Offloading for Dependent and Parallel Tasks in Cloud-Edge Environments Using Deep Reinforcement Learning, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 35, 3, pp. 391-404, (2024); Wu, Honghai, Federation-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Cooperative Cache in Vehicular Edge Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 11, 2, pp. 2550-2560, (2024)","","Springer","","","","","","15730484; 09208542","","JOSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207174863"

Lower-level problems include fatigue life of bearings and adhesion of insulating coatings.

First, the design of efficient automatic train operation (ATO) driving is carried out using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). Then, the timetable is optimized including a regenerated energy model and the number of trains required to satisfy the periodic service.

By harnessing the small-world network model and the advanced optimization capabilities of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), we address the complex challenges of station placement and network design. Our application of the small-world theory ensures that charging stations are optimally interconnected, fostering network resilience and ensuring consistent service availability.

Two custom genetic operators (mutation and crossover) are proposed and compared to conventional operators (PMX and swap mutation). To obtain elite configurations, a tuning phase involving all of the aforementioned algorithms is carried out. Experiments were divided by problem size, with three to five objectives tested.

These interdependent challenges are of significant research interest. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated approach to optimize energy management control and system design for an FCHEV, featuring a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS), by employing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). The optimization process targets maximizing driving range and FC lifespan, while concurrently minimizing hydrogen consumption, HESS size, and overall lifetime costs. The health-driven fuzzy logic-based energy management strategy (HFBEMS) is proposed to allocates power demand between the FC and HESS effectively by considering FCHEV operating cost optimization and the thermal constraints for battery safety. The optimized FCHEV configuration achieved a hydrogen consumption rate of 0.58 kg/100 km and driving range of 411.4 km for US06 test driving conditions, while maintaining an optimal trade-off among all objectives. Furthermore, this optimized HFBEMS proved resilient under real-world driving conditions like US06 and UDDS, while ensures compliance with operational constraints, including FC power ramp rate limits, SOC limits, and thermal safety constraints, minimizing FC and battery degradation. A comparative analysis of various EMS revealed that the proposed HFBEMS exhibit notable superiority in minimizing hydrogen fuel consumption, achieving reductions of approximately 38.30% and 25.46%, when compared to the conventional PI control and frequency-decoupling fuzzy-based control, respectively. Consequently, an optimized HFBEMS, due to its rule-based structure and minimal execution complexity, is suitable for real-time integration within a vehicle, and outperforms conventional methods by optimally balancing key performance criteria. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battery degradation; dimensioning of FCHEV; fuel cell degradation; fuzzy logic control; health-aware optimization; optimal sizing","Battery management systems; Cost benefit analysis; Energy utilization; Fuel cell vehicles; Fuel cells; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid vehicles; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Programmable logic controllers; Safety engineering; Secondary batteries; Battery degradation; Dimensioning of FC hybrid electric vehicle; Energy; Fuel cell degradations; Fuzzy logic control; Fuzzy-Logic; Health-aware optimization; Management strategies; Optimal sizing; Optimisations; Economic and social effects; Fuzzy logic","","","","Juginović, Alen, Health impacts of air pollution exposure from 1990 to 2019 in 43 European countries, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Sikora, Alicja, European Green Deal – legal and financial challenges of the climate change, ERA Forum, 21, 4, pp. 681-697, (2021); Int Leg Mater, (2016); Morfeldt, Johannes, Carbon footprint impacts of banning cars with internal combustion engines, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 95, (2021); Sierzchula, William, The influence of financial incentives and other socio-economic factors on electric vehicle adoption, Energy Policy, 68, pp. 183-194, (2014); Munsi, Md Shahin, Comprehensive Analysis of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles: Challenges, Powertrain Configurations, and Energy Management Systems, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 145459-145482, (2024); Ahmed, Afaq, Conditioned Adaptive Barrier Function Based Integral Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control for Electric Vehicles With Hybrid Energy Storage System, IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology, 6, pp. 92-108, (2025); IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, (2024); Tanaka, Shintaro, Fuel cell system for Honda CLARITY fuel cell, eTransportation, 3, (2020); Macias Fernandez, Alvaro, Effects of Price Range Variation on Optimal Sizing and Energy Management Performance of a Hybrid Fuel Cell Vehicle, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 38, 3, pp. 1626-1638, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","00189545; 19399359","","ITVTA","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017445684"

An optimization problem involving flexural strength and elastic modulus as primary responses is solved by implementing NSGA − III and MOGWO intelligent algorithms. The independent filament material extrusion process parameters examined were infill density, deposition angle, nozzle temperature, and printing speed. All parameters had three levels and were assigned to a Box–Behnken customized response surface design for fabricating the corresponding samples, thereby obtaining results related to flexural properties.

A key aspect of RMS efficiency is process planning, which involves assigning machines to specific operations and scheduling them. This phase plays a vital role in enhancing system performance. However, balancing customer preferences with system efficiency remains a challenge. Reliability is a critical factor in this context, as a high reliability score helps minimize system failure rates. This study proposes a reliable RMS model that addresses a multi-objective process plan generation problem, aiming to optimize RMT allocation. The objectives are: (i) minimizing total production time, (ii) reducing production cost, and (iii) maximizing the reliability of RMTs. To solve this, the NSGA-III algorithm is employed to generate a Pareto-optimal set of process plans. These plans are then evaluated using two Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods–TOPSIS and VIKOR. The resulting rankings from both methods are analyzed and compared using Spearman’s rank correlation and the similarity rank coefficient. Experimental findings indicate a strong correlation between the two methods, with VIKOR showing high consistency with TOPSIS in ranking process plans for RMS optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","MCDM; NSGA-III; process plan; reconfigurable machine tool (RMT); Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs); Reliability","","","","","Ashraf Ali, Masood, Configuration selection for a reconfigurable manufacturing flow line involving part production with operation constraints, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 98, 5-8, pp. 2137-2156, (2018); Babaeinesami, Abdollah, A closed-loop supply chain configuration considering environmental impacts: a self-adaptive NSGA-II algorithm, Applied Intelligence, 52, 12, pp. 13478-13496, (2022); Belaiche, Leila, Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Approach for Throughput Maximization in Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems, (2018); Belaiche, Leila, Bi-objective framework for planning a supply chain process in reconfigurable manufacturing systems, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 52, 13, pp. 1675-1680, (2019); Haddou Benderbal, Hichem, Machine layout design problem under product family evolution in reconfigurable manufacturing environment: a two-phase-based AMOSA approach, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 104, 1-4, pp. 375-389, (2019); Haddou Benderbal, Hichem, Flexibility-based multi-objective approach for machines selection in reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) design under unavailability constraints, International Journal of Production Research, 55, 20, pp. 6033-6051, (2017); Haddou Benderbal, Hichem, Modularity assessment in reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) design: an Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing-based approach, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 94, 1-4, pp. 729-749, (2018); Bensmaine, Abderrahmane, A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based approach for optimal machines selection in reconfigurable manufacturing environment, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 66, 3, pp. 519-524, (2013); Bi, Xiaojun, A niche-elimination operation based NSGA-III algorithm for many-objective optimization, Applied Intelligence, 48, 1, pp. 118-141, (2018); Bortolini, Marco, Reconfigurable manufacturing systems: Literature review and research trend, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 49, pp. 93-106, (2018)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","0951192X; 13623052","","ICIME","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014918028"

These vulnerabilities, particularly in dense or adversarial environments, undermine the reliability of cooperative perception, anomaly detection, and safety-critical maneuver execution. This paper presents CR-V2XR, a cross-layer, federated, and trust-aware coordination framework designed to enhance resilience in connected and autonomous vehicular networks. CR-V2XR integrates multi-modal anomaly detection with delay-sensitive trust estimation using features extracted from basic safety messages (BSMs), behavioral deviations, entropy shifts, and inter-vehicle trust validation. The architecture employs federated learning for distributed anomaly detection without centralized aggregation and uses a control layer that supports delay-aware trajectory selection. A multi-objective NSGA-III optimizer enables online trade-off adaptation across detection accuracy (DA), collision probability, and communication overhead. Simulations across eleven adversarial scenarios, including Sybil, wormhole, falsification, and replay attacks, demonstrate that CR-V2XR achieves 95% detection accuracy under worst-case attacks, reduces collision probability from 0.61 to 0.27 at 300 vehicles, maintains bounded delay, typically 45–60 ms under nominal load, and remains resilient under high-stress conditions with delays up to 180 ms and communication overhead (≤ 6.1 MB/s). Compared to centralized IDS and stateless baselines, CR-V2XR improves detection fidelity, scalability, and robustness under non-IID data and partial synchronization. These results establish CR-V2XR as a viable architecture for delay-constrained, trust-centric coordination in federated V2X environments subject to persistent adversarial threats. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cyber-physical security; federated learning; intelligent transportation systems (ITS); intrusion detection systems (IDS); multi-agent coordination; trust modeling; Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication","Anomaly detection; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Intelligent agents; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Network architecture; Network security; Traffic control; Trusted computing; Vehicle detection; Vehicles; Centralised; Cyber-Physical securities; Intelligent transportation system; Intelligent transportation systems; Intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-agent coordinations; Trust models; Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication; Economic and social effects","","","","J Urban Dev Manag, (2023); Alam, Tanweer, Smart mobility adoption in sustainable smart cities to establish a growing ecosystem: Challenges and opportunities, MRS Energy and Sustainability - A Review Journal, 11, 2, pp. 304-316, (2024); Campi, Elena, Roundabouts: Traffic Simulations of Connected and Automated Vehicles - A State of the Art, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 25, 5, pp. 3305-3325, (2024); Andreou, Andreas C., Advancing Smart City Infrastructure with V2X Vehicle-Road Collaboration: Architectural and Algorithmic Innovations, Internet of Things, Part F4006, pp. 173-186, (2025); Delwar, Tahesin Samira, The Intersection of Machine Learning and Wireless Sensor Network Security for Cyber-Attack Detection: A Detailed Analysis, Sensors, 24, 19, (2024); Sedar, Roshan, A Comprehensive Survey of V2X Cybersecurity Mechanisms and Future Research Paths, IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society, 4, pp. 325-391, (2023); Clancy, Joseph, Wireless Access for V2X Communications: Research, Challenges and Opportunities, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 26, 3, pp. 2082-2119, (2024); Vieira, Emanuel, Enabling Seamless Data Security, Consensus, and Trading in Vehicular Networks, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 9, 10, pp. 6716-6737, (2024); Abdi, Behzad, Advancing Vulnerable Road Users Safety: Interdisciplinary Review on V2X Communication and Trajectory Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 26, 3, pp. 2921-2943, (2025); Abbass, Waseem, Optimizing Spectrum Utilization and Security in SAS-Enabled CBRS Systems for Enhanced 5G Performance, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 165992-166010, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014591478"

Currently, this approach faces the challenge of KPI metrics redundancy. Although existing studies have used feature selection methods to address this issue, the optimal number of KPI metrics remains difficult to determine. Furthermore, existing failure prediction models have not achieved satisfactory performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a failure prediction method, MOFSDF, which leverages multi-objective optimization and the deep forest model. The method aims to achieve optimal failure prediction performance with the fewest KPI metrics. MOFSDF frames the selection of KPI metrics as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the number of KPI metrics while simultaneously maximizing the model's performance. This optimization process is achieved through the NSGA-III algorithm. Furthermore, the integration of the deep forest model guarantees both the robustness and generalization capabilities of the failure prediction model. We use the ZTE dataset for the empirical study. The results demonstrate that MOFSDF significantly outperforms other comparative methods across multiple dimensions. Compared to nine classical models, the Accuracy improvement ranges from 1.1% to 97.9%, while the Macro−F1 improvement ranges from 1.1% to 179.4%. The Kappa and HammingLoss also show significant improvements. Moreover, the findings from the ablation studies further substantiate the rationale and effectiveness of the component configuration within MOFSDF. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep forest; Failure prediction; Feature selection; KPI metrics data; Multi-objective optimization","Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Outages; Prediction models; Safety engineering; Deep forest; Distributed systems; Failure prediction models; Failures prediction; Features selection; Forest modelling; Key performance indicator metric data; Key performance indicators; Multi-objectives optimization; System failures; Feature extraction","","","This work is supported in part by Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (Grant Nos. 23KJD580001 , 23KJA580002 and 22KJB580002 ), the Excellent Teaching Team of the 2022 QingLan Project of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (Big Data Technology Teaching Team with Shipping Characteristic) .","Vatter, Jana, The Evolution of Distributed Systems for Graph Neural Networks and Their Origin in Graph Processing and Deep Learning: A Survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 56, 1, (2024); undefined, (2023); Chen, Ningjiang, Anomaly detection for key performance indicators by fusing self-supervised spatio-temporal graph attention networks, Knowledge-Based Systems, 300, (2024); Ai for It Operations Aiops on Cloud Platforms Reviews Opportunities and Challenges, (2023); Park, Jinseong, In-Distribution Public Data Synthesis with Diffusion Models for Differentially Private Image Classification, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 12236-12246, (2024); Fang, Qingkai, Can We Achieve High-quality Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation without Parallel Speech Data?, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 7264-7277, (2024); Zhou, Zhihua, Deep forest: Towards an alternative to deep neural networks, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 0, pp. 3553-3559, (2017); Yuan, Zhidan, Empirical Studies on Failure Prediction for Distributed Systems Based on Feature Selection, pp. 43-52, (2024); Xue, Bing, A Survey on Evolutionary Computation Approaches to Feature Selection, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 4, pp. 606-626, (2016); Kowalski, Piotr Andrzej, Feature selection for regression tasks base on explainable artificial intelligence procedures, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2023-June, (2023)","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","26666030","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013650757"

This paper addresses a multi-objective permutation flow shop rescheduling problem with mixed blocking constraints and time-dependent job weights. A multi-objective model and predictive-reactive rescheduling strategy based on a posteriori optimisation are proposed. In the reactive phase, the objective is to minimise the Total Weighted Waiting Time (TWWT) for efficiency and the Average Completion Time Deviation (ACTD) for stability. The use of population-based stochastic algorithms enables the generation of approximate Pareto fronts, allowing decision-makers to explore trade-offs before selecting a new schedule. Additionally, their stochastic nature makes them well suited for highly disrupted systems, where exact methods are computationally expensive. To validate the proposed rescheduling strategy, we implemented it using three population-based algorithms (NSGA-II, NSGA-III and U-NSGA-III). Their performance was assessed through the Mean Hypervolume metric. Statistical analysis confirmed the superior performance of NSGA-II. These findings support the robustness of the proposed strategy and its potential for application in dynamic scheduling environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","blocking constraints; dynamic scheduling; flexible manufacturing systems; multi-objective optimisation; permutation flow shop; Production rescheduling","","","","This work has been entirely developed at the LGIPM laboratory of the University of Lorraine, Metz, France.","undefined, (2017); Al-Behadili, Mohanad, Multi-objective biased randomised iterated greedy for robust permutation flow shop scheduling problem under disturbances, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 71, 11, pp. 1847-1859, (2020); Blank, Julian, Pymoo: Multi-Objective Optimization in Python, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 89497-89509, (2020); Borgonjon, Tessa, A two-phase Pareto front method for solving the bi-objective personnel task rescheduling problem, Computers and Operations Research, 138, (2022); Cavallieri, María Sol, Sustainable production scheduling: insights from real-life applications, Production Planning and Control, 36, 12, pp. 1595-1622, (2025); Das, Indraneel, A closer look at drawbacks of minimizing weighted sums of objectives for Pareto set generation in multicriteria optimization problems, Structural Optimization, 14, 1, pp. 63-69, (1997); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998); undefined, (2000); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","23302674; 23302682","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012259051"

By solving multi-objective problems, decision-makers can make more sustainable decisions. To efficiently solve multi-objective problems, an adaptive strategy is proposed to optimize the crossover and mutation operators of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Moreover, the multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem is modeled by incorporating worker fatigue factors. Finally, the algorithm performance was tested using ZDT and DTLZ series test functions, and the multi-objective solving performance of the algorithm was tested based on standard examples FMk01-FMk06.The results showed that in the ZDT1 and ZDT2 test functions, the solution set coverage of the proposed algorithm was 0.833 and 0.906, respectively, and the inverse generation distance was 0.006 and 0.0059, respectively, achieving better convergence and diversity. In the DTLZ1 test function, the inverse generation distance of the proposed algorithm did not exceed 2. In the FMk03 example, the inverse generation distance of the proposed algorithm was 0.009, which was lower than the traditional NSGA-II algorithm. In the FMk06 example, the proposed algorithm achieved a super volume of 0.37, which was higher than the multi-objective squirrel search algorithm and NSGA-III algorithm.

Therefore, it is necessary to propose a more accurate scheduling model based on the real tobacco enterprise. Firstly, this paper proposes a high-dimensional multi-objective cigarette production scheduling model considering time, cost, energy consumption, number of card changes, and load balancing. Secondly, a self-adaptive NSGA-III algorithm (SA_NSGA-III) based on indicator guidance is proposed to better solve the modified model and generate a scheduling scheme that can effectively improve the production performance. SA_NSGA-III introduces PD diversity evaluation indicators to guide the population evolution and solve the problem of poor diversity in the late convergence stage of the algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified by real data examples from enterprises, and the results show that compared with other comparative algorithms, the SA_NSGA-III algorithm achieves optimal results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cigarette production; evolutionary algorithm; optimisation; scheduling","Energy utilization; Optimization; Problem solving; Production control; Scheduling algorithms; Tobacco; Cigarette production; Enterprise IS; High-dimensional; Model-based OPC; Multi objective; Optimisations; Optimization problems; Production Scheduling; Production scheduling problems; Scheduling models; Evolutionary algorithms","","","This research was funded by \u2018Research and Application of Enterprise Brain Theory, Methods, and Key Technologies Based on Brain Graph Model\u2019, grant number \u2018ZJZY2023E002\u2019.","Alizamir, Meysam, Investigating Landfill Leachate and Groundwater Quality Prediction Using a Robust Integrated Artificial Intelligence Model: Grey Wolf Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithm and Extreme Learning Machine, Water (Switzerland), 15, 13, (2023); Amponsah, Shadrach Yaw, A Multiple Objective Genetic Algorithm Approach for Stochastic Open Pit Production Scheduling Optimisation, International Journal of Mining, Reclamation and Environment, 37, 6, pp. 460-487, (2023); Asafuddoula, Md, A decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for many objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 3, pp. 445-460, (2015); Bai, Hui, Multi-UAV Cooperative Trajectory Planning Based on Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm, Complex System Modeling and Simulation, 2, 2, pp. 130-141, (2022); Cai, Xingjuan, A Many-Objective Optimization Based Federal Deep Generation Model for Enhancing Data Processing Capability in IoT, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 19, 1, pp. 561-569, (2023); Cai, Zhenjun, Heterogeneity of total factor productivity of export tobacco enterprises under the link of tobacco production scheduling, Tobacco Regulatory Science, 7, 4, pp. 287-294, (2021); Chakraborty, Uday Kumar, Floating-point to integer mapping schemes in differential evolution for permutation flow shop scheduling, International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 2, 3-4, pp. 183-204, (2010); Chen, Weiye, Simulation and Multi-Objective Optimization of Three-Column Double-Effect Methanol Distillation by NSGA-III Algorithm, Processes, 11, 5, (2023); Cui, Zhihua, A many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on constraints for collaborative computation offloading, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 77, (2023); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","17580366; 17580374","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010546472"

A formal statement of the problem of optimizing marketing strategies for agricultural production has been given by using the genetic algorithm NSGA-III. A hybrid method was devised to solve the task of multi-criteria optimization of marketing strategies for agro-industrial enterprises. The method is based on the NSGA-III algorithm in combination with the XGBoost software library and adapted to industry constraints for marketing strategies in the agricultural markets of Ukraine and Kazakhstan Republic. This allows for the generation and interpretation of Pareto-optimal strategies taking into account such criteria as efficiency, coverage, return on investment (ROI), costs, and engagement. A cluster analysis of solutions has been performed; three characteristic scenarios were identified – balanced, cautious, and aggressive. Empirical validation by regression analysis demonstrated the high accuracy of the model, as well as its ability to extrapolate new solutions. In particular, the mean square error on the test sample was 0.0316 with the achieved coefficient of determination of 0.9041. The results confirm the effectiveness of the devised method to support decision-making under conditions of multi-criteria and limited resources. The proposed method was used as the basis for the development of software implemented in practice at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex. However, the scope of method application also includes the activities by other business entities that devise marketing strategies to achieve the efficiency of their activities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cluster analysis; digital marketing; hybrid method; multi-criteria optimization; NSGA-III algorithm","","","","","Proceedings of the International Conference on Agriculture Social Sciences Education Technology and Health Icasseth 2019, (2020); Valenzuela-Hurtado, Yervi, Elements of digital marketing and the positioning of the company INNOVA BIOTECH AGRO SAC, Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia - Serie de Conferencias, 2, (2023); Jadhav, Gauri Girish, A systematic literature review: digital marketing and its impact on SMEs, Journal of Indian Business Research, 15, 1, pp. 76-91, (2023); Saura, Jose Ramon, Setting B2B digital marketing in artificial intelligence-based CRMs: A review and directions for future research, Industrial Marketing Management, 98, pp. 161-178, (2021); Lima, Gustavo Correa, Agro 4.0: Enabling agriculture digital transformation through IoT, Revista Ciencia Agronomica, 51, 5, (2020); Martins, Fellipe Silva, A fuzzy AHP analysis of potential criteria for initiatives in digital transformation for agribusiness, Revista de Administracao Mackenzie, 24, 1, (2023); Kanellos, Nikos, Digital Marketing Strategies and Profitability in the Agri-Food Industry: Resource Efficiency and Value Chains, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 14, (2024); Saravanan, R., A PERSPECTIVE OF DIGITAL MARKETING IN RURAL AREAS: A LITERATURE REVIEW, International Journal of Professional Business Review, 8, 4, (2023); Dang, Yugong, An Improved Multi-Objective Optimization Decision Method Using NSGA-III for a Bivariate Precision Fertilizer Applicator, Agriculture (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2022); Chen, Huijun, Enterprise marketing strategy using big data mining technology combined with XGBoost model in the new economic era, PLOS ONE, 18, 6 June, (2023)","","Technology Center","","","","","","17294061; 17293774","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010231860"

It employs a Gaussian process-assisted fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (GP-NSGA-II) for both circuit synthesis and layout optimization. Traditional genetic algorithms are computationally intensive and have poor convergence, making them difficult to use with three-dimensional full-wave simulators. To address these issues, the authors incorporate Gaussian process regression from Bayesian optimization into NSGA-II, improving convergence and computational efficiency. The method integrates layout simulation and optimization, enabling automatic PA design with direct layout optimization. To demonstrate the method’s effectiveness, the authors design a wide-band PA and a tri-band PA using a 10-W gallium-nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). The tests show that the prototypes perform well: the wide-band PA has a power-added efficiency (PAE) of over 61% and an output power greater than 41.5 dBm in the 2-3 GHz band, while the tri-band PA achieves PAE values of over 59%, 55%, and 57% in the 0.7-1.1 GHz, 2.3-2.5 GHz, and 3.4-3.5 GHz bands, respectively, with output powers exceeding 41.2 dBm, 40.6 dBm, and 40.6 dBm. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic design automation; gallium nitride; layout automation; non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm; optimization; power amplifier","Automation; Computational efficiency; Computer aided design; Flexible electronics; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); High electron mobility transistors; Power HEMT; Screening; Sorting; Electronics design automation; Gaussian Processes; Layout automation; Layout optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-II; Optimisations; Power; Tri-bands; Wide-band; Gallium nitride; Genetic algorithms; III-V semiconductors; Power amplifiers","","","","Raffo, Antonio, Microwave Wireless Communications: From Transistor to System Level, pp. 1-386, (2016); Raffo, Antonio, Assessing GaN FET Performance Degradation in Power Amplifiers for Pulsed Radar Systems, IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters, 28, 11, pp. 1035-1037, (2018); Li, Qirong, Design of broadband high-efficiency power amplifiers based on the hybrid continuous inverse mode, IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest, 2016-August, (2016); Chen, Jinhu, Design of broadband high-efficiency power amplifiers based on a series of continuous modes, IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters, 24, 9, pp. 631-633, (2014); Chen, Shichang, Wide-band/Multi-band Doherty and outphasing power amplifier designs, pp. 204-207, (2019); Piacibello, Anna, 3-Way Doherty Power Amplifiers: Design Guidelines and MMIC Implementation at 28 GHz, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 71, 5, pp. 2016-2028, (2023); Camarchia, Vittorio, The Doherty power amplifier: Review of recent solutions and trends, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 63, 2, pp. 559-571, (2015); Giofrè, Rocco, An ultra-broadband GaN Doherty amplifier with 83% of fractional bandwidth, IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters, 24, 11, pp. 775-777, (2014); Wang, Weiwei, A Dual-Band Outphasing Power Amplifier Based on Noncommensurate Transmission Line Concept, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 68, 7, pp. 3079-3089, (2020); Pednekar, Prathamesh H., RF-Input Load Modulated Balanced Amplifier with Octave Bandwidth, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 65, 12, pp. 5181-5191, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","02780070","","ITCSD","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009932950"

Recently, the dynamic ensemble selection (DES) technique, which adaptively selects an appropriate classifier ensemble for each sample, has shown great promise in this domain. However, traditional DES methods often rely on bootstrap sampling to generate base classifiers, potentially overlooking the intrinsic structure of input data and reducing predictive performance. Additionally, existing profit-oriented credit risk models fail to accommodate the heterogeneous risk preferences of investors. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model, DES-CBCG-MOO, which combines (1) a clustering-based classifier generation (CBCG) module to enhance diversity among base classifiers, and (2) a multi-objective optimization (MOO) component that integrates NSGA-III into the META-DES framework to jointly optimize risk and profitability. To enhance model transparency, we employ SHAP for post-hoc interpretation of predictions. Experiments on a real-world lending dataset demonstrate that DES-CBCG-MOO outperforms the baselines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit risk assessment; ensemble learning; interpretability; investor preference analysis; multi-objective optimization","","","","","Amozegar, Mahdiyeh, An ensemble of dynamic neural network identifiers for fault detection and isolation of gas turbine engines, Neural Networks, 76, pp. 106-121, (2016); International Journal of Research Studies in Management, (2013); Schapire, Robert E., Boosting the margin: A new explanation for the effectiveness of voting methods, Annals of Statistics, 26, 5, pp. 1651-1686, (1998); Bastani, Kaveh, Wide and deep learning for peer-to-peer lending, Expert Systems with Applications, 134, pp. 209-224, (2019); Bernardi, Enrico, The impact of the dependence structure in risk management: a focus on credit-risk, International Journal of General Systems, 48, 4, pp. 335-361, (2019); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Cerqueira, Vítor, Evaluating time series forecasting models: an empirical study on performance estimation methods, Machine Learning, 109, 11, pp. 1997-2028, (2020); Chang, Yungchia, Application of eXtreme gradient boosting trees in the construction of credit risk assessment models for financial institutions, Applied Soft Computing, 73, pp. 914-920, (2018); Chen, Ning, Financial credit risk assessment: a recent review, Artificial Intelligence Review, 45, 1, pp. 1-23, (2016); Chi, Guotai, Long-horizon predictions of credit default with inconsistent customers, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 198, (2024)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","15635104; 03081079","","IJGSA","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009473097"

Robust solutions that remain stable despite variations in design parameters are essential for decision-makers. This study investigates Type I and Type II robustness approaches within constrained many-objective optimization (MaOO) frameworks, which are rarely explored in humanoid robotics. It focuses on optimizing the gait cycle of a 25-degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) NAO humanoid robot (NAO is an acronym for ‘Nao d'Amour’, also sometimes referred to as ‘Now, Autonomous and Operative’) during single- and double-support phases. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) algorithm is employed to address four conflicting objectives, such as minimizing power consumption, maximizing stability, minimizing torque fluctuations, and reducing gait cycle time. A detailed comparative analysis highlights the superiority of Type II robustness, offering better-distributed and more convergent solutions in real-world scenarios with several constraints and variables.

In response, we introduce BASS, a versatile multi-branch search space, together with a hybrid optimisation framework that couples NSGAIII’s global exploration with fine-grained local search. The local phase is preliminarily instantiated with hill climbing, tabu search and simulated annealing, enabling a systematic comparison of their ability to refine candidate architectures. We cast the task as a tri-objective problem that maximises predicted PSNR while minimising floating-point operations and parameter count, ensuring that discovered networks remain both accurate and efficient. Extensive experiments show that hybridising NSGA-III with local search accelerates convergence and consistently yields superior architectures; the hill-climbing variant offers the best overall trade-off. The resulting BASSN models attain competitive peak signal-to-noise ratios across ×2, ×3 and ×4 upscaling factors while fitting diverse resource envelopes, providing a practical and scalable route toward deployable SRIR solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated machine learning; deep learning; evolutionary computation; image restoration; neural architecture search; Pareto optimization; super resolution","Budget control; Deep neural networks; Digital arithmetic; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Nearest neighbor search; Optical resolving power; Pareto principle; Restoration; Simulated annealing; Tabu search; Automated machine learning; Automated machines; Deep learning; Machine-learning; Multi objective; Neural architecture search; Neural architectures; Pareto-optimization; Search spaces; Superresolution; Economic and social effects; Image reconstruction","","","This work was supported in part by the National Council of Humanities, Science, and Technology (CONAHCyT) through Ciencia de Frontera 2023 under Grant CF-2023-I-801.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a probabilistic flow-guided two-stage strategy for many-objective optimization (MaOEA-PGTS). MaOEA-PGTS divides evolution into an exploratory phase and a convergence phase, and dynamically balances diversity and convergence via probabilistic-flow control. In the first stage, candidate solutions are classified into optimal, intermediate, and worst streams using a probabilistic-flow strategy. Each stream is assigned a performance-based probability weight, which is dynamically adjusted via the Poisson cumulative distribution function. In the second stage, the algorithm employs an adaptive thresholding mechanism is employed to reduce the probability of missegregation between solution streams. Finally, the algorithm integrates a normally distributed probability density function to optimize the selection of individuals during the selection process and further maintain inter-population balance. MaOEA-PGTS is tested against seven state-of-the-art algorithms (Two_Arch2, IBEA, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, AGE-II, MOPSO, CMOPSO) on standard many-objective optimization problems, specifically the DTLZ and WFG test functions.

To enhance planning efficiency and convergence accuracy, this paper proposes an improved NSGA-III multi-objective optimization algorithm based on Hopfield neural network. First, we construct an optimization objective function considering three dimensions: the length of the manipulator’s motion path, motion time, and joint impact. We introduce a Hopfield neural network to replace the initial random sampling of the NSGA-III algorithm, allowing for the rapid generation of an initial optimized population. Based on non-dominance relationships, we use reference points for population crossover, mutation, and selection, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimal solution. Additionally, we employ seventh-degree polynomial smooth interpolation to improve the geometric properties of the trajectory. The main contributions include: By utilizing the energy gradient of the Hopfield neural network, we rapidly reduce the random sampling space formed by the multi-objective functions along the gradient direction towards the suboptimal solution set. This approach effectively eliminates a significant number of inferior solutions during the iterations of NSGA-III, leading to a marked improvement in the efficiency of generating the Pareto front.

Genetic Programming (GP) is acknowledged for its wide use in evolving dispatching rules for JSS, offering an automated approach to heuristic generation. A dispatching rule can use many machine-related, job-related, and system-related features to create scheduling heuristics in JSS. Proper feature selection is a critical factor for the success of heuristics. Moreover, there can be many features in JSS whose importance varies from one scenario to another. It has been shown that irrelevant and redundant features can adversely affect performance. Feature selection is a promising task to select relevant features and reduce genetic programming hyper-heuristics (GPHH) search space. However, more research is needed to quantify the contribution of features in the GPHH to many-objective JSS. The proposed algorithm introduces an adaptive search strategy that is implemented through re-initialization during the evolutionary process. In addition, relevant features are selected based on their frequency of occurrence in diverse sets of best individuals. The proposed algorithm, Adaptive Feature Selection-GP-NSGA-III (AFS-GP-NSGA-III), is compared with the FS-GP-NSGA-III and standard GP-NSGA-III on a four-objective JSS problem. The experimental results indicate that feature selection using GP and adaptive search can improve the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, the findings suggest the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm for generating improved dispatching rules for training and unseen test instances using only the selected relevant feature subset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive search; feature selection; genetic programming; hyper-heuristic; job shop scheduling; many-objective optimization","Heuristic programming; Job shop scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Adaptive search; Critical applications; Dispatching rules; Features selection; Hyper-heuristics; Job-Shop scheduling; Many-objective optimizations; Performance; Relevant features; Search-based; Genetic programming","","","","Pinedo, Michael L., Scheduling: Theory, algorithms, and systems: Fourth edition, 9781461423614, pp. 1-673, (2012); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Jain, Himanshu, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point based nondominated sorting approach, Part II: Handling constraints and extending to an adaptive approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 602-622, (2014); Masood, Atiya, A PSO-based reference point adaption method for genetic programming hyper-heuristic in many-objective job shop scheduling, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10142 LNAI, pp. 326-338, (2017); Masood, Atiya, Many-objective genetic programming for job-shop scheduling, pp. 209-216, (2016); Blazewicz, Jacek, The job shop scheduling problem: Conventional and new solution techniques, European Journal of Operational Research, 93, 1, pp. 1-33, (1996); Automatic Design of Dispatching Rules for Job Shop Scheduling with Genetic Programming, (2013); Nguyen, Su, Automatic programming via iterated local search for dynamic job shop scheduling, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 45, 1, pp. 1-14, (2015); Genetic Programming with Adaptive Representations, (1994); Masood, Atiya, Feature Selection for Evolving Many-Objective Job Shop Scheduling Dispatching Rules with Genetic Programming, pp. 644-651, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002451086"

However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113× compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

This paper introduces a novel repair approach integrating counterfactual causality with a multi-objective algorithm to mitigate critical security property issues, including backdoor attacks, safety violations, and unfairness. Firstly, we abstract the neural network into a counterfactual structure causal model, utilizing a causal trace to allocate contributions to each hidden layer neuron for output prediction. Secondly, ”faulty” neurons are identified through fault location, utilizing counterfactual causality between positive and negative example-guided attributes and neuronal contribution. Finally, an ablation study determines the number of neurons for repair. The multi-objective algorithm NSGA-III is then applied to optimize the faulty neurons, adjusting weight parameters to rectify erroneous behavior and eliminate vulnerabilities while maximizing the model's accuracy. This method achieves notable Pareto optimization and effectively eliminates vulnerabilities in neural networks. In comparative experiments against CARE (CAusality-based REpair) techniques, our Counterfactual Causality-Based Repair (CCBR) method significantly reduces backdoor attack success rates and security violations to less than 1%, while maintaining model accuracy and ensuring security for normal inputs. In fairness repair tasks, CCBR improves fairness by 92.56%, a substantial 19.56% increase over CARE. These results affirm the robustness and practicality of CCBR, establishing it as a valuable tool for enhancing neural network safety and fairness. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causality analysis; Counterfactual inference; Multi-objective optimization; Neural network repair","Multilayer neural networks; Backdoors; Causality analysis; Counterfactual inference; Counterfactuals; Modeling accuracy; Multi objective algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Network repairs; Neural network repair; Neural-networks; Multiobjective optimization","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 2024GXNSFBA010248, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62162004 and U21A20474, in part by the High-Level Innovation Team of Guangxi Colleges and Universities and Outstanding Scholars Fund, China, and part by Guangxi Collaborative Innovation Center of Multi-source Information Integration and Intelligent Processing, China.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 2024GXNSFBA010248 , in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62162004 and U21A20474 , in part by the High-Level Innovation Team of Guangxi Colleges and Universities and Outstanding Scholars Fund , and part by Guangxi Collaborative Innovation Center of Multi-source Information Integration and Intelligent Processing .","Causal Discovery in Probabilistic Networks with an Identifiable Causal Effect, (2022); Bauer-Marquart, Fabian, SpecRepair: Counter-Example Guided Safety Repair of Deep Neural Networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13255 LNCS, pp. 79-96, (2022); Blank, Julian, Pymoo: Multi-Objective Optimization in Python, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 89497-89509, (2020); Blank, Julian, Investigating the normalization procedure of NSGA-III, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11411 LNCS, pp. 229-240, (2019); Bongers, Stephan, Foundations of structural causal models with cycles and latent variables, Annals of Statistics, 49, 5, pp. 2885-2915, (2021); Brown, Robin A., A Unified View of SDP-based Neural Network Verification through Completely Positive Programming, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 151, pp. 9334-9355, (2022); Chattopadhyay, Aditya, Neural network attributions: A causal perspective, 2019-June, pp. 1660-1676, (2019); Adversarial Robustness for Machine Learning, (2023); Cheng, Siyuan, Deep Feature Space Trojan Attack of Neural Networks by Controlled Detoxification, 2A, pp. 1148-1156, (2021); Automated Repair of Neural Networks, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201421448"

Proposed a comprehensive modeling layout for the optimal management of power and heat in the distribution system, taking into account load emergencies such as overload and load shedding. Incorporated different energy sources, such as renewables, batteries, power to hydrogen, CHP sources, and heat storage tanks, as well as demand response programs for both electrical and thermal loads. What is the implication of the main finding? The proposed approach aims to effectively balance the energy supply and demand in the network, especially during emergency situations, to certify the system’s reliability and stability. Provided a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for managing the distribution network, while also improving its resilience and reducing the risk of energy supply disruptions. This study introduces an advanced Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model tailored for comprehensive electrical and thermal energy management in small-scale smart grids, addressing emergency load shedding and overload situations. The model integrates combined heat and power sources, capable of simultaneous electricity and heat generation, alongside a mobile photovoltaic battery storage system, a wind resource, a thermal storage tank, and demand response programs (DRPs) for both electrical and thermal demands. Power-to-hydrogen systems are also incorporated to efficiently convert electrical energy into heat, enhancing network synergies. Utilizing the robust Gurobi solver, the model aims to minimize operating, fuel, and maintenance costs while mitigating environmental impact. Simulation results under various scenarios demonstrate the model’s superior performance. Compared to conventional evolutionary methods like particle swarm optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III, and biogeography-based optimization, the proposed model exhibits remarkable improvements, outperforming them by 11.4%, 5.6%, and 11.6%, respectively. This study emphasizes the advantages of employing DRP and heat tank equations to balance electrical and thermal energy relationships, reduce heat losses, and enable the integration of larger photovoltaic systems to meet thermal constraints, thus broadening the problem’s feasible solution space. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","battery; combined heat and power; demand response; energy management; renewable energy resources","","","","","Shojaeiyan, Sattar, Microgrids Resiliency Enhancement against Natural Catastrophes Based Multiple Cooperation of Water and Energy Hubs, Smart Cities, 6, 4, pp. 1765-1785, (2023); Li, Dacheng, Combined capacity and operation optimisation of lithium-ion battery energy storage working with a combined heat and power system, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 140, (2021); Zhao, Xinyu, Short-term probabilistic predictions of wind multi-parameter based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network with attention mechanism and multivariate copula distribution estimation, Energy, 234, (2021); Zhou, Kaile, Hybrid robust decentralized optimization of emission-aware multi-energy microgrids considering multiple uncertainties, Energy, 265, (2023); Amorim, Elizete De Andrade, Optimization of wind-thermal economic-emission dispatch problem using NSGA-III, IEEE Latin America Transactions, 18, 9, pp. 1555-1562, (2020); Yang, Dongfeng, Economic-emission dispatch problem in integrated electricity and heat system considering multi-energy demand response and carbon capture Technologies, Energy, 253, (2022); Ellahi, Manzoor, A Modified Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization With Bat Algorithm Parameter Inspired Acceleration Coefficients for Solving Eco-Friendly and Economic Dispatch Problems, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 82169-82187, (2021); Ellahi, Manzoor, A Hybrid Metaheuristic Approach for the Solution of Renewables-Incorporated Economic Dispatch Problems, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 127608-127621, (2020); Lu, Shuai, Economic Dispatch of Integrated Energy Systems with Robust Thermal Comfort Management, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 12, 1, pp. 222-233, (2021); Zhu, Zhi, Optimal Configuration of Power/Thermal Energy Storage for a Park-Integrated Energy System Considering Flexible Load, Energies, 16, 18, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","26246511","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213473211"

However, existing research on battery system safety only focuses on one aspect, with limited studies simultaneously addressing heat dissipation and collision safety. Therefore, this paper presents a gradient porosity aluminum foam battery module (GPAF-BM) with high heat dissipation efficiency and excellent crashworthiness by utilizing the enhanced heat transfer capability and good energy absorption characteristics of gradient open-cell aluminum foam (OCAF). To further improve its comprehensive performance, the heat dissipation efficiency and crashworthiness of the GPAF-BM are strictly optimized with multiple objectives. Additionally, to improve the efficiency of approximate model modeling, a new hybrid scaling multi-fidelity (NHSMF) approximate model construction method is proposed, which effectively improves the prediction accuracy of the model with a small sample size. Finally, the third-generation nondominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and normal boundary intersection (NBI) method are employed to ascertain the optimal solution. Compared to the original design, the optimized maximum intrusion displacement of the battery (D<inf>max</inf>) is 22.29% lower and the maximum battery temperature (T<inf>max</inf>) is reduced by 0.49 °C, the pressure drop of the (ΔP) decreased from the original design of 129.71 Pa to 115.53 Pa, a decrease of 10.93%.

These problems are referred to as constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). Many meta-heuristics for solving CMOPs, called constrained multi-objective meta-heuristics (CMOMHs) have been introduced in the literature, including those using particle swarm optimization (PSO)(Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995), genetic algorithms (GAs)(Man et al., 1996), and differential evolution (DE)(Storn and Price, 1997). CMOMHs can be grouped into four different classes: classic CMOMHs, co-evolutionary approaches, multi-stage approaches, and multi-tasking approaches. An extensive comparative study of twenty different CMOMHs on a wide variety of test problems, including real-world CMOPs in the fields of science and engineering, is conducted. A multi-swarm PSO approach called constrained multi-guide particle swarm optimization (ConMGPSO) is introduced and compared to the best-performing previous approaches according to the comparative study. The performance of each algorithm was found to be problem dependent, however the best overall approaches were ConMGPSO, paired-offspring constrained evolutionary algorithm (POCEA)(He et al., 2021), adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (A-NSGA-III)(Jain and Deb, 2014), and constrained multi-objective framework using Q-learning and evolutionary multi-tasking (CMOQLMT)(Ming and Gong, 2023). ConMGPSO and POCEA had the best performance on the CF benchmark set, which contains examples of bi-objective and tri-objective CMOPs with disconnected CPOFs. The CMOQLMT approach had the best performance on the DAS-CMOP benchmark set, which contain additional difficulty in terms of feasibility-, convergence-, and diversity-hardness. For the selected real-world CMOPs, A-NSGA-III had the best performance overall. ConMGPSO was shown to have the best performance on the process, design, and synthesis problems, and had competitive performance for the power system optimization problems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained multi-objective optimization; Differential evolution; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization; Real-world problems","Benchmarking; Constrained optimization; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Multitasking; Optimization algorithms; Comparatives studies; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Differential Evolution; Multi-objective Meta-heuristics; Multi-objective optimization problem; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Performance; Real-world problem; Swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grant.","Kennedy, James, Particle swarm optimization, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks - Conference Proceedings, 4, pp. 1942-1948, (1995); Storn, Rainer, Differential Evolution - A Simple and Efficient Heuristic for Global Optimization over Continuous Spaces, Journal of Global Optimization, 11, 4, pp. 341-359, (1997); Man, Kim F., Genetic algorithms: Concepts and applications, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 43, 5, pp. 519-534, (1996); Chhipa, Rohan Hemansu, Comparison of constraint handling approaches in multi-objective optimization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10841 LNAI, pp. 345-362, (2018); Rahimi, Iman, A Review on Constraint Handling Techniques for Population-based Algorithms: from single-objective to multi-objective optimization, Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 30, 3, pp. 2181-2209, (2023); Liang, Jing, A Survey on Evolutionary Constrained Multiobjective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 27, 2, pp. 201-221, (2023); Coello, Carlos A., Moses: A multiobjective optimization tool for engineering design, Engineering Optimization, 31, 1-3, pp. 337-368, (1999); Homaifar, Abdollah M., Constrained optimization via genetic algorithms, Simulation, 62, 4, pp. 242-254, (1994); Woldesenbet, Yonas Gebre, Constraint handling in multiobjective evolutionary optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 13, 3, pp. 514-525, (2009); Carlson, Susan E., Annealing a genetic algorithm over constraints, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 4, pp. 3931-3936, (1998)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205424442"

Achieving these objectives is particularly challenging in optimization problems with more than three objectives, known as many-objective optimization problems. Multi-objective algorithms often fall short in exerting adequate selection pressure towards the Pareto front in these scenarios and difficult to keep solutions evenly distributed, especially in cases with irregular Pareto fronts. In this study, the focus is on overcoming these challenges by developing an innovative and efficient a novel Many-Objective Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (MaOGOA). MaOGOA incorporates reference point, niche preserve and information feedback mechanism (IFM) for superior convergence and diversity. A comprehensive array of quality metrics is utilized to characterize the preferred attributes of Pareto Front approximations, focusing on convergence, uniformity and expansiveness diversity in terms of IGD, HV and RT metrics. It acknowledged that MaOGOA algorithm is efficient for many-objective optimization challenges. These findings confirm the approach effectiveness and competitive performance.

The methodology is based on an application of ensemble artificial neural networks, which significantly accelerates computational processes. Coupled with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III, this approach facilitates efficient multi-objective optimization, yielding a comprehensive Pareto front and high-quality design solutions. Here, the framework is applied to the design of gas-bearing-supported turbocompressors. These systems are challenging due to their sensitivity to manufacturing variations, particularly in the gas-bearing geometry, which can lead to rotordynamic instability. Additionally, the interdependencies between the subsystems, such as axial and journal bearings, rotor, compressor impellers, and magnets, necessitate a multidisciplinary approach that spans aerodynamics, structural dynamics, rotordynamics, mechanics, loss analyses, and more. A clear tradeoff between system efficiency, mass-flow range, and robustness has been identified for the compressor design. Higher nominal compressor mass-flows, i.e., increased nominal power, is suggested to decrease the hypervolume of feasible manufacturing deviations. Hence, there is a sweet power spot for gas-bearing supported turbomachinery. Further, the framework’s computational efficiency is on par with that of a university cluster, while only employing a desktop computer equipped with a consumer-grade graphics card. This work demonstrates a significant advancement in the design of complex engineering systems and sets a new standard for speed and efficiency in computational engineering design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; artificial neural networks; computational efficiency; constrained multi-objective optimization; data-driven design; design automation; design for manufacturing; design integration; design of multiscale systems; design optimization; gas-bearings; herringbone grooved journal bearings; machine learning; manufacturing deviations; metamodeling; micro-turbomachinery; multidisciplinary design optimization; robust design; robustness metrics; surrogate modeling; turbocompressor design","Aerodynamics; Computer aided design; Constrained optimization; Design aids; Gas turbines; Gases; Genetic algorithms; Industrial research; Machine design; Mass transfer; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; Shape optimization; Structural dynamics; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Data-driven design; Design automations; Design for Manufacturing; Design integrations; Design of multiscale system; Design optimization; Herringbone grooved journal bearing; Machine-learning; Manufacturing deviation; Metamodeling; Micro-turbomachinery; Multi-disciplinary design optimisation; Multi-scale system; Robust designs; Robustness metrics; Surrogate modeling; Turbocompressor; Turbocompressor design; Computational efficiency","","","","Advances in Structural Optimization, (1995); SIAM Journal on Optimization, (1994); Martins, Joaquim R.R.A., Multidisciplinary design optimization: A survey of architectures, AIAA Journal, 51, 9, pp. 2049-2075, (2013); Sobieszczanski-Sobieski, Jaroslaw, Multidisciplinary aerospace design optimization: Survey of recent developments, Structural Optimization, 14, 1, pp. 1-23, (1997); Meng, Debiao, Multidisciplinary design optimization of engineering systems under uncertainty: a review, International Journal of Structural Integrity, 13, 4, pp. 565-593, (2022); Hasenkamp, Torben, A review of practices for robust design methodology, Journal of Engineering Design, 20, 6, pp. 645-657, (2009); Arvidsson, Martin, Principles of robust design methodology, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 24, 1, pp. 23-35, (2008); Göhler, Simon Moritz, Robustness metrics: Consolidating the multiple approaches to quantify robustness, Journal of Mechanical Design, 138, 11, (2016); Meng, Debiao, Uncertainty-Based Design and Optimization Using First Order Saddle Point Approximation Method for Multidisciplinary Engineering Systems, ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part A: Civil Engineering, 6, 3, (2020); Park, Gyung Jin, Robust design: An overview, AIAA Journal, 44, 1, pp. 181-191, (2006)","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","","","","","","10500472","","JMDEE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199703519"

Existing algorithms suffer from curse of dimensionality i.e., they are unable to balance convergence with diversity in extensive decision-making scenarios. MaOWOA introduces strategies to accelerate convergence, balance convergence and diversity in solutions and enhance diversity in high-dimensional spaces. The prime contributions of this paper are—development of MaOWOA, incorporation an Information Feedback Mechanism (IFM) for rapid convergence, a Reference Point-based Selection (RPS) to balance convergence and diversity and a Niche Preservation Strategy (NPS) to improve diversity and prevent overcrowding. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MaOWOA superior performance over existing algorithms (MaOPSO, MOEA/DD, MaOABC, NSGA-III) across LSMOP1-LSMOP9 benchmarks and RWMaOP1-RWMaOP5 problems. Results validated using Wilcoxon rank sum tests, highlight MaOWOA excellence in key metrics such as generational distance, spread, spacing, runtime, inverse generational distance and hypervolume, outperforming in 71.8% of tested scenarios. Thus, MaOWOA represents a significant advancement in many-objective optimization, offering new avenues for addressing LSMOPs and RWMaOPs’ inherent challenges. This paper details MaOWOA development, theoretical basis and effectiveness, marking a promising direction for future research in optimization strategies amidst growing problem complexity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Diversity; Many-objective optimization; Many-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm; Pareto optimality","Benchmarking; Inverse problems; Pareto principle; Convergence; Diverse fields; Diversity; Engineering design; Large-scales; Many-objective optimizations; Many-objective whale optimization algorithm; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Pareto-optimality; Decision making","","","This article was supported by the project Students Grant Competition SP2024/087, \""Specific Research of Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies\"", financed by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic and Faculty of Mechanical Engineering V\u0160B-TUO.","Ahmad, Naseer, Multi-objective optimization in the development of oil and water repellent cellulose fabric based on response surface methodology and the desirability function, Materials Research Express, 4, 3, (2017); Amarjeet, Many-objective artificial bee colony algorithm for large-scale software module clustering problem, Soft Computing, 22, 19, pp. 6341-6361, (2018); Asafuddoula, Md, A decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for many objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 3, pp. 445-460, (2015); Bader, Johannes, HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 45-76, (2011); Cao, Bin, Many-Objective Deployment Optimization for a Drone-Assisted Camera Network, IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering, 8, 4, pp. 2756-2764, (2021); Cai, Lei, A clustering-ranking method for many-objective optimization, Applied Soft Computing, 35, pp. 681-694, (2015); Chen, Yensheng Sheng, Performance enhancement of multiband antennas through a two-stage optimization technique, International Journal of RF and Microwave Computer-Aided Engineering, 27, 2, (2017); Cheng, Ran, Test Problems for Large-Scale Multiobjective and Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 47, 12, pp. 4108-4121, (2017); Cheng, Jixiang, A Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Enhanced Mating and Environmental Selections, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 4, pp. 592-605, (2015); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18756891; 18756883","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197260781"

Through efficient placement, the VNF placement technology strives to operate VNFs consistently to the greatest extent possible within restricted resources. Thus, VNF mapping and scheduling tasks can be framed as an optimization problem. Existing research efforts focus only on optimizing the VNFs scheduling or mapping. Besides, the existing methods focus only on one or two objectives. In this work, we proposed addressing the problem of VNFs scheduling and mapping. This work proposed framing the problem of VNFs scheduling and mapping as a multi-objective optimization problem on three objectives, namely (1) minimizing line latency of network link, (2) reducing the processing capacity of each virtual machine, and (3) reducing the processing latency of virtual machines. Then, the proposed VNF-NSGA-III algorithm, an adapted variation of the NSGA-III algorithm, was used to solve this multi-objective problem. Our proposed algorithm has been thoroughly evaluated through a series of experiments on homogeneous and heterogeneous data center environments. The proposed method was compared to several heuristic and recent meta-heuristic methods. The results reveal that the VNF-NSGA-III outperformed the comparison methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heuristic algorithms; Mapping and scheduling; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Virtual network functions; VNFs","Function evaluation; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Mapping; Multiobjective optimization; Network security; Scheduling algorithms; Transfer functions; Virtual machine; Heuristics algorithm; Mapping and scheduling; Multi-objectives optimization; Network functions; NSGA-III; Virtual network function; Virtual networks; Heuristic algorithms","","","This work is partly funded by the Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 62172151).","Chowdhury, Mosharaf, A survey of network virtualization, Computer Networks, 54, 5, pp. 862-876, (2010); Promwongsa, Nattakorn, Ensuring Reliability and Low Cost When Using a Parallel VNF Processing Approach to Embed Delay-Constrained Slices, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 17, 4, pp. 2226-2241, (2020); Miyamura, Takashi, Joint optimization of optical path provisioning and VNF placement in vCDN, Optical Switching and Networking, 49, (2023); Fang, Jin, Reveal: Robustness-aware VNF placement and request scheduling in edge clouds, Computer Networks, 233, (2023); IEICE Transactions on Communications, (2023); Gholipoor, Narges, E2E QoS Guarantee for the Tactile Internet via Joint NFV and Radio Resource Allocation, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 17, 3, pp. 1788-1804, (2020); Li, Junling, On dynamic mapping and scheduling of service function chains in SDN/NFV-enabled networks, Proceedings - IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM, (2019); Qu, Long, Delay-Aware Scheduling and Resource Optimization with Network Function Virtualization, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 64, 9, pp. 3746-3758, (2016); Luizelli, Marcelo Caggiani, Optimizing NFV Chain Deployment through Minimizing the Cost of Virtual Switching, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2018-April, pp. 2150-2158, (2018); Khebbache, Selma, A multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for VNF chains placement, 2018-January, pp. 1-4, (2018)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18756891; 18756883","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187227123"

However, FEER comes up with some additional computational overheads, therefore, in the abnormal circumstances, such as emergency evacuations, the proposed FEER protocol allows sensor nodes to utilize their own intelligence to optimize evacuation routes and communicates critical information to emergency services. Therefore, the proposed FEER-θ-NSA-III protocol offers a robust solution for energy-efficient routing and enhanced safety in smart buildings. Among the proposed FEER variants and other competitive protocols, FEER-θ-NSGA-III outperforms in terms of average remaining energy, network stability period, and network lifetime. It also significantly reduces end-to-end delays and achieves higher average remaining energy values. While FEER-θ-NSGA-III resulted in slightly higher computational and overhead time compared to competitive protocols, this increase is minor considering its superior performance in energy conservation, stability period, and network lifetime. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building safety; Clustering; Energy conservation; Fog computing; Safe evacuation; Smart building; θ-NSGA","Energy efficiency; Intelligent buildings; Smart homes; Building safety; Clusterings; Energy; Energy efficient routing; Energy efficient routing protocol; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Performance; Remaining energies; Safe evacuation; Θ-θ-non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Sensor nodes","","","","Chouhan, Nitesh, Taylor political optimizer-based cluster head selection in IOT-assisted WSN networks, International Journal of Communication Systems, 37, 7, (2024); Cluster Computing, (2024); Asiedu, Derek Kwaku Pobi, Energy-efficient routing, power control and energy clustering for energy harvesting-enabled spectrum sharing IoT sensor networks, Internet of Things (The Netherlands), 25, (2024); Vahid Dastjerdi, Amir, Fog Computing: Helping the Internet of Things Realize Its Potential, Computer, 49, 8, pp. 112-116, (2016); Osamy, Walid, SEACDSC: secure and energy-aware clustering based on discrete sand cat swarm optimization for IoT-enabled WSN applications, Wireless Networks, 30, 4, pp. 2781-2800, (2024); Saadati, Morteza, Energy efficient clustering for dense wireless sensor network by applying Graph Neural Networks with coverage metrics, Ad Hoc Networks, 156, (2024); Mahmud, Redowan, Fog Computing: A taxonomy, survey and future directions, Internet of Things, 0, 9789811058608, pp. 103-130, (2018); Jamaesha, S.

Existing research has predominantly concentrated on optimizing aircraft delay and the financial implications of early or late landings. However, given the paramount significance of airport fuel costs at airports and the critical need for efficient fuel utilization, we aim to minimize airplane fuel consumption by streamlining operational time. In this paper, we present an innovative model with two main objectives: minimizing airplane fuel consumption by reducing dwell time and minimizing cost operation. To address these dual objectives concurrently, we propose a new method known as the multi populations of multiple objectives (MPMO) framework, which is modeled through a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) called MPNSGA-II. First, MPNSGA-II employs two separate populations to optimize each objective. Second, to prevent populations from fixating solely on their respective single objectives, MPNSGA-II introduces an archive sharing strategy (ASS). This technique stores elite solutions gathered from two populations. Additionally, we introduce an archive update strategy (AUS) to enhance the quality of solutions stored in the archive. The proposed algorithm has been compared with other well-known algorithms, NSGA-II, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm shows a cost reduction in 18.01%, 16.75%, and 15.21%. Statistical precision, underscored through the application of the nonparametric Friedman test, corroborates the supremacy of the proposed method, clinching the highest ranking compared to state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aircraft landing problem; Multi-objective optimization; Multiple populations; NSGA-II","Aircraft; Cost reduction; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Aircraft landing problem; Financial implications; Landing problems; Multi objective; Multi population; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiple populations; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Optimization problems; Scheduling problem; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Cecen, Ramazan Kursat, Emission and Flight Time Optimization Model for Aircraft Landing Problem, Transportation Research Record, 2677, 2, pp. 763-773, (2023); da Silva, Lorrany Cristina, A NEW MODELLING FOR THE AIRCRAFT LANDING PROBLEM AND MATHEURISTIC APPROACH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT, Pesquisa Operacional, 43, (2023); Messaoud, Meriem Ben, A thorough review of aircraft landing operation from practical and theoretical standpoints at an airport which may include a single or multiple runways, Applied Soft Computing, 98, (2021); Su, Jiaming, A Large Neighborhood Search Algorithm with Simulated Annealing and Time Decomposition Strategy for the Aircraft Runway Scheduling Problem, Aerospace, 10, 2, (2023); Solving the Aircraft Landing Problem Using the Bee Colony Optimization Bco Algorithm, (2024); Shirini, Kimia, Modified imperialist competitive algorithm for aircraft landing scheduling problem, Journal of Supercomputing, 80, 10, pp. 13782-13812, (2024); Aryania, Azra, Energy-Aware Virtual Machine Consolidation Algorithm Based on Ant Colony System, Journal of Grid Computing, 16, 3, pp. 477-491, (2018); Mirjalili, Seyedali, Genetic algorithm, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 780, pp. 43-55, (2019); Mirjalili, Seyedali, Ant colony optimizer: Theory, literature review, and application in AUV path planning, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 811, pp. 7-21, (2020); Nssibi, Maha, Gene selection for high dimensional biological datasets using hybrid island binary artificial bee colony with chaos game optimization, Artificial Intelligence Review, 57, 3, (2024)","","Springer","","","","","","15730484; 09208542","","JOSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200952928"

As the number of objectives increases, the sharp rise in non-dominated individuals makes it challenging for the algorithm to differentiate their quality, resulting in a loss of selection pressure. The application of the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) method can balance convergence and diversity in algorithms. The PBI method guides the evolution of individuals by integrating the parallel and perpendicular distances between individuals and reference vectors, where the penalty factor is crucial for balancing these two distances and significantly affects algorithm performance. Therefore, a comprehensive adaptive penalty scheme was proposed and applied to NSGA-III, named caps-NSGA-III, to achieve balance and symmetry between convergence and diversity. Initially, each reference vector’s penalty factor is computed based on its own characteristic. Then, during the iteration process, the penalty factor is adaptively adjusted according to the evolutionary state of the individuals associated with the corresponding reference vector. Finally, a monitoring strategy is designed to oversee the penalty factor, ensuring that adaptive adjustments align with the algorithm’s needs at different stages. Through a comparison involving benchmark experiments and two real-world problems, the competitiveness of caps-NSGA-III was demonstrated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","comprehensive adaptive penalty scheme; many-objective optimization; NSGA-III; penalty-based boundary intersection","","","","This work was supported by the Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Plan Project under grant 20220203184SF and the General Project of Graduate Innovation Program at Beihua University ([2023]051).","Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, (2001); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Asafuddoula, Md, A decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for many objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 3, pp. 445-460, (2015); Bao, Chunteng, A new adaptive decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for multi- and many-objective optimization, Expert Systems with Applications, 213, (2023); Bader, Johannes, HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 45-76, (2011); Sun, Yanan, IGD Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization Problems, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 23, 2, pp. 173-187, (2019); Yuan, Jiawei, An adaptive parental guidance strategy and its derived indicator-based evolutionary algorithm for multi- and many-objective optimization, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 84, (2024); Zhu, Chao, Multi-Objective Path-Decision Model of Multimodal Transport Considering Uncertain Conditions and Carbon Emission Policies, Symmetry, 14, 2, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20738994","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207677907"

The mainstream method of desulfurization employed in the coal-fired power generation sector now is wet flue gas desulfurization. This process is known to have a high cost and be energy-/materially intensive. Due to the complicated desulfurization mechanism, it is challenging to improve the overall sustainability profile involving energy-, cost-, and resource-relevant objectives via traditional mechanistic models. As such, the present study formulated a data-driven many-objective model for the sustainability of the desulfurization process. We preprocessed the actual operation data collected from the desulfurization tower in a domestic ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plant with a 600 MW unit. The extreme random forest algorithm was adopted to approximate the objective functions as prediction models for four objectives, namely, desulfurization efficiency, unit power consumption, limestone supply, and unit operation cost. Three metrics were utilized to evaluate the performance of prediction. Then, we incorporated differential evolution and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III to optimize the multiple parameters and obtain the Pareto front. The results indicated that the correlation coefficient (R2) values of the prediction models were greater than 0.97. Compared with the original operation condition, the operation under optimized parameters could improve the desulfurization efficiency by 0.25% on average and reduce energy, cost, and slurry consumption significantly. This study would help develop operation strategies to improve the sustainability of coal-fired power plants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","differential evolution; extreme random forest; many-objective optimization; NSGA-III; parameters prediction","coal-fired power plant; correlation; genetic algorithm; limestone; optimization; power plant; sustainability; China","","","This study received financial support from the Project of Guangdong Science and Technology Innovation Strategy (Grant number STKJ202209065), and STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents (Grant numbers NTF20019 and NTF23037).","Electricity Market Report 2023, (2023); Dong, Quande, A many-objective optimization for an eco-efficient flue gas desulfurization process using a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 16, (2021); Jie, Dingfei, The future of coal supply in China based on non-fossil energy development and carbon price strategies, Energy, 220, (2021); Cheng, Gan, Research progress on desulfurization technology of high-sulfur bauxite, Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China (English Edition), 32, 10, pp. 3374-3387, (2022); Cheng, Gan, A novel method for the desulfurization of medium–high sulfur coking coal, Fuel, 335, (2023); Rathnayake, Mahinsasa, Utilization of coal fly ash and bottom ash as solid sorbents for sulfur dioxide reduction from coal fired power plant: Life cycle assessment and applications, Journal of Cleaner Production, 202, pp. 934-945, (2018); Wypiór, Tomasz, Effect of ammonia and ammonium compounds on wet-limestone flue gas desulfurization process from a coal-based power plant – Preliminary industrial scale study, Fuel, 281, (2020); Chen, Zhen, Enhancement of Mass Transfer between Flue Gas and Slurry in the Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization Spray Tower, Energy and Fuels, 32, 1, pp. 703-712, (2018); Zheng, Chenghang, Experimental Study on Removal Characteristics of SO3 by Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization Absorber, Energy and Fuels, 32, 5, pp. 6031-6038, (2018); Liu, Shan, Operation strategy optimization of desulfurization system based on data mining, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 81, pp. 144-158, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206593700"

However, establishing a retrofit strategy is challenging due to conflicting objectives, such as cost and performance level, requiring optimization for effective decision-making. This study proposes a many-objective optimization model for seismic retrofitting using FRP and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-III. The model's efficacy was demonstrated through two numerical examples: a reinforced concrete building retrofitted with FRP jackets and a masonry-infilled reinforced concrete building retrofitted with FRP bracings. Each example included three objective functions and multiple constraints. Nonlinear static pushover analysis provided optimal strategies to enhance base shear and energy dissipation while minimizing costs and retrofitting locations. Among the Pareto-optimal solutions, the optimal solution with the minimum Euclidean distance was selected.

However, NSGA-III offered a wider range of solutions than NSGA-II across all objective functions. As discussed earlier, the larger standard deviation of the solutions from NSGA-III supports this observation. In Fig. 14(b), NSGA-III identified additional solutions beyond the objective value of f1 at approximately 0.8, which NSGA-II did not achieve in three trial attempts. Given that these solutions present more alternatives for maximizing energy dissipation, the comparison suggests that NSGA-III could be more effective than NSGA-II in addressing many-objective problems.This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (Grant No. RS-2023-00220019).","Guide for the Design and Construction of Externally Bonded Frp Systems for Strengthening Concrete Structures, (2008); ACI 318 08 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary, (2025); Afroughsabet, Vahid, High-performance fiber-reinforced concrete: a review, Journal of Materials Science, 51, 14, pp. 6517-6551, (2016); Asafuddoula, Md, A decomposition based evolutionary algorithm for many objective optimization with systematic sampling and adaptive epsilon control, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7811 LNCS, pp. 413-427, (2013); Badoux, Marc, Steel bracing of RC frames for seismic retrofitting, Journal of Structural Engineering, 116, 1, pp. 55-74, (1990); Bakhshinezhad, Sina, Multi-objective optimal design of semi-active fluid viscous dampers for nonlinear structures using NSGA-II, Structures, 24, pp. 678-689, (2020); Baloch, Hassan, Assessment of shrinkage and bond behaviour of high performance cement-based composites as a repair mortar, Developments in the Built Environment, 15, (2023); Bank, Lawrence C., Composites for Construction: Structural Design with FRP Materials, pp. 1-551, (2007); Advances in Earthquake Engineering for Urban Risk Reduction, (2006); Binici, Barış, Analysis and design of FRP composites for seismic retrofit of infill walls in reinforced concrete frames, Composites Part B: Engineering, 38, 5-6, pp. 575-583, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","26661659","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199181868"

Consequently, an adaptive boundary-based selection many-objective evolutionary algorithm with density estimation, MaOEA/ABS-DE, is proposed. Specifically, the algorithm initially utilizes prior information regarding the adaptive estimation of the shape of the Pareto front to perform coordinate transformation on the population, thus guiding the population towards the approximate boundary of the current Pareto front. Subsequently, a novel approach for estimating the neighboring density of individuals is introduced by utilizing the distribution information of the transformed population. Furthermore, adaptive boundary-based selection and shifted-based density estimation selection strategies are designed for the environmental selection process. The environmental selection process is completed through a two-step selection. In the first step, a candidate pool is formed by selecting solutions with lower neighboring density, which aims to maintain a broad search for the population in the objective space. In the second step, the SDE is introduced to compare the convergence of individuals in the candidate pool, and those with the optimal SDE values are selected.

To detect coronavirus X-ray images can be used. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used commonly to detect illness from images. There can be lots of different alternative deep CNN models or architectures. To find the best architecture, hyper-parameter optimization can be used. In this study, the problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Objective functions are multi-class cross entropy, error ratio, and complexity of the CNN network. For the best solutions to the objective functions, multi-objective hyper-parameter optimization is made by NSGA-III, NSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, SMS-EMOA, MOEA/D, and proposed Swarm Genetic Algorithms (SGA). SGA is a swarm-based algorithm with a cross-over process. All six algorithms are run and give Pareto optimal solution sets. When the figures obtained from the algorithms are analyzed and algorithm hypervolume values are compared, SGA outperforms the NSGA-III, NSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, SMS-EMOA, and MOEA/D algorithms. It can be concluded that SGA is better than others for multi-objective hyper-parameter optimization algorithms for COVID-19 detection from X-ray images.

With the rapid iteration of products, performance obsolescence emerges as the primary driver of product remanufacturing. Consequently, remanufacturing of spent products badly needs to shift from performance recovery to upgrading. However, remanufacturing upgrade design scheme is challenging to be effectively optimized, as it requires to flexibly balance the bidirectional customization demands of product residual value utilization and technical performance improvement considering diverse failure characteristics and upgrading demands. Therefore, an adaptive design optimization method is proposed. With the optimization objectives of improving technical performance and saving cost and energy, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based surrogate model is built to evaluate the design scheme. Design parameters are identified based on technical failure characteristics to quantify demands, and working conditions are simultaneously input to jointly guide the direction of design optimization. Then, to obtain the optimal design parameters, an adaptive design optimization model based on transfer learning and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA III) is constructed to attain autonomous adjustment to different bidirectional customization demands. Specifically, a sample adding strategy is designed to expand transfer learning data. Aiming at different expected working conditions, transfer learning is used to adaptively adjust the model parameters of CNN in each iteration to ensure its prediction accuracy. NSGA III is applied to solve the optimization model and generate design parameters that meet bidirectional customization demands. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in response to the challenge of converting abstract descriptions of improving technical performance of spent products into a mechanism model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive upgrade design; Customization demands; Deep transfer learning; NSGA III; Remanufacturing","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Product design; Adaptive designs; Adaptive upgrade design; Customisation; Customization demand; Deep transfer learning; Design optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Remanufacturing; Transfer learning; Obsolescence","","","This research work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075396, Grant No. 52105527) and Chunhui Project Foundation of the Education Department of China (HZKY20220338).

To tackle this challenge, this study introduces a novel algorithm named Many-Objective Dragonfly Algorithm (MaODA). This method incorporates reference point, niche preserve and information feedback mechanism for maintaining better balance between convergence and diversity. Through this study, the MaODA effectiveness is established by using the WFG1-WFG9 test suite for 4, 6 and 8 objectives and five real-world (RWMaOP1- RWMaOP5) design problems.

Due to the real-time generation of takeout orders, the delivery system is required to be extremely dynamic, so the AGV needs to be dynamically scheduled. At the same time, the uncertainty in the delivery process (such as the meal preparation time) further increases the complexity and difficulty of AGV scheduling. Considering the influence of these two factors, the method of embedding a stochastic programming model into a rolling mechanism is adopted to optimize the AGV delivery routing. Specifically, to handle real-time orders under dynamic demand, an optimization mechanism based on a rolling scheduling framework is proposed, which allows the AGV’s route to be continuously updated. Unlike most VRP models, an open chain structure is used to describe the dynamic delivery path of AGVs. In order to deal with the impact of uncertain meal preparation time on route planning, a stochastic programming model is formulated with the purpose of minimizing the expected order timeout rate and the total customer waiting time. In addition, an effective path merging strategy and after-effects strategy are also considered in the model. In order to solve the proposed mathematical programming model, a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on a NSGA-III framework is developed. Finally, a series of experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model and algorithm. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AGV; NSGA-III; rolling scheduling; routing combination; stochastic programming; takeout terminal delivery","Automatic guided vehicles; Dynamic programming; Dynamic routing algorithms; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling algorithms; Stochastic programming; Vehicle routing; Automated guided vehicles; Dynamic scheduling; NSGA-III; Real- time; Rolling scheduling; Routing combination; Routings; Stochastic programming model; Stochastics; Takeout terminal delivery; Stochastic models","","","This research was funded by the Basic scientific research Project of colleges and universities of Liaoning Province Department of Education in 2024, grant number LJ212410153031 and the APC was funded by the Liaoning Province Education Department.","undefined; Giuffrida, Nadia, Optimization and Machine Learning Applied to Last-Mile Logistics: A Review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 9, (2022); Liu, Lei, A new knowledge-guided multi-objective optimisation for the multi-AGV dispatching problem in dynamic production environments, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 17, pp. 6030-6051, (2023); undefined; Liu, Yan, FooDNet: Toward an Optimized Food Delivery Network Based on Spatial Crowdsourcing, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 18, 6, pp. 1288-1301, (2019); Xue, Guiqin, Optimization of Rider Scheduling for a Food Delivery Service in O2O Business, Journal of Advanced Transportation, 2021, (2021); Optimization Online, (2018); Yıldız, Barış, Provably High-quality solutions for the meal delivery routing problem, Transportation Science, 53, 5, pp. 1372-1388, (2019); Du, Jing, CrowDNet: Enabling a Crowdsourced Object Delivery Network Based on Modern Portfolio Theory, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 5, pp. 9030-9041, (2019); Steever, Zachary, Dynamic courier routing for a food delivery service, Computers and Operations Research, 107, pp. 173-188, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205309594"

This research area is of great concern to the researchers, and this work intends to propose a new Cluster-based VANET routing model with steps like (a) optimal cluster head selection (CHS) and (b) appropriate gateway selection for data transmission. Here, the optimal CHS takes place considering the Packet delivery ratio (PDR), mean routing load, end-to-end (e2e) Delay, Throughput, and packet overhead. This paper introduced a new Customized hunger’s foraging honey badger with a Dynamic multi-objective non-sorted genetic algorithm (CHFHB-DMNSGA). Also, the gateway selection is done under two objectives: Vehicular gateway mobility and receiver signal strength, respectively. Finally, the paper presented a comparative assessment to validate the effectiveness of the adopted algorithm CHFHB-DMNSGA over the other algorithms like R-NSGA-II, NSGA-III, NSGA-II, HBA, HGS, ABC, FF, CSO, ACO, LA, MHB-GA, GA-FF, and HFCHBO. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CHFHB-DMNSGA; Cluster; Gateway selection; Overhead; Throughput; VANET routing","Gateways (computer networks); Mercury compounds; Multiobjective optimization; Signal receivers; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Ad hoc Networks Routing; Cluster; Cluster-head selections; Customized hunger’s foraging honey badger with a dynamic multi-objective non-sorted genetic algorithm; Gateway selection; Multi objective; Non-sorted genetic algorithms; Overhead; Vehicular ad hoc network routing; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Genetic algorithms","","","","Goudarzi, Forough, Traffic-aware VANET routing for city environments-a protocol based on ant colony optimization, IEEE Systems Journal, 13, 1, pp. 571-581, (2019); Wu, Jinqiao, RSU-Assisted Traffic-Aware Routing Based on Reinforcement Learning for Urban Vanets, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 5733-5748, (2020); Hossain, Md Asif, Multi-Objective Harris Hawks Optimization Algorithm Based 2-Hop Routing Algorithm for CR-VANET, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 58230-58242, (2021); Sayad Haghighi, Mohammad Sayad, Highly Anonymous Mobility-Tolerant Location-Based Onion Routing for VANETs, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 4, pp. 2582-2590, (2020); Kandali, Khalid, A New Hybrid Routing Protocol Using a Modified K-Means Clustering Algorithm and Continuous Hopfield Network for VANET, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 47169-47183, (2021); Liu, Hao, Parking-area-assisted spider-web routing protocol for emergency data in urban VANET, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 69, 1, pp. 971-982, (2020); Wang, Yunwei, ARPLR: An All-Round and Highly Privacy-Preserving Location-Based Routing Scheme for VANETs, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 23, 9, pp. 16558-16575, (2022); Zhao, Liang, Novel Online Sequential Learning-Based Adaptive Routing for Edge Software-Defined Vehicular Networks, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 20, 5, pp. 2991-3004, (2021); Daas, Mohamed Skander, Optimizing geographic routing protocols for urban VANETs using stigmergy, social behavior and adaptive C-n-F mechanisms: An optimized CLWPR, Vehicular Communications, 14, pp. 97-108, (2018); Wang, Xiaonan, Reliable routing in IP-based VANET with network gaps, Computer Standards and Interfaces, 55, pp. 80-94, (2018)","","Springer","","","","","","1572834X; 09296212","","WPCOF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200966483"

In this context, scheduling problems are encountering new environmental and human-related challenges, and the concept of sustainable scheduling has gained importance, aiming to balance economic, environmental, and human factors. In this paper, we propose two multi-objective mathematical models to simultaneously address these three factors as objective functions. In the first model, we consider the operator safety while using the Occupational Repetitive Action (OCRA) index to assess ergonomic risks related to task execution. The second model includes workers’ preferences in terms of machines, shifts and task variety. The objective is to improve the general well-being of workers by proposing a schedule that respects as much as possible their preferences. Both models integrate the travel time of workers and products between machines. To solve these NP-hard scheduling problems, we use the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms II and III (NSGA-II and NSGA-III), enhanced with a Q-learning strategy for parameter selection and a variable neighborhood search based on reinforcement learning. The obtained results provide a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between these criteria, demonstrating the capability of such approach to achieve a favorable balance between multiple objectives while addressing the new challenges of production scheduling in Industry 5.0 context. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental consideration; Human centric manufacturing; Industry 5.0; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-II; NSGA-III; Sustainability; Sustainable flexible job-shops scheduling problem","Balancing; Genetic algorithms; Job shop scheduling; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Travel time; Environmental considerations; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Human centric manufacturing; Human-centric; Industry 5.0; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-II; NSGA-III; Sustainable flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Akbari, Mohammad, Scheduling part-time and mixed-skilled workers to maximize employee satisfaction, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 64, 5-8, pp. 1017-1027, (2013); Demirkol Akyol, Sebnem, ErgoALWABP: a multiple-rule based constructive randomized search algorithm for solving assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem under ergonomic risk factors, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 30, 1, pp. 291-302, (2019); Amjad, Muhammad Kamal, Recent Research Trends in Genetic Algorithm Based Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2018, (2018); Berti, Nicola, Ageing workforce effects in Dual-Resource Constrained job-shop scheduling, International Journal of Production Economics, 237, (2021); Bezoui, Madani, Integrating preferences within multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling, European Journal of Operational Research, 305, 3, pp. 1079-1086, (2023); Blank, Julian, Pymoo: Multi-Objective Optimization in Python, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 89497-89509, (2020); Caldeira, Rylan H., A Pareto based discrete Jaya algorithm for multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 170, (2021); Caldeira, Rylan H., An effective backtracking search algorithm for multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling considering new job arrivals and energy consumption, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 149, (2020); undefined, (2016); Castillo-Salazar, J.

A genetic algorithm based on speed invariant and the elite algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-TSP assignment problem. To ensure the integration of the population, a population resettlement strategy with elite lakes was proposed to improve the probability of population transfer to the best Pareto solution. The experiment verified that this strategy can approach the optimal solution more closely during the population convergence process, and compared it with traditional Multi TSP algorithms and single function multi-objective Multi TSP algorithms. By comparing the total distance and maximum deviation of multiple robot systems, it is proven that this algorithm can effectively balance the path length of each robot in task allocation. From the research results, it can be seen that in genetic algorithms, resetting the population after reaching precocity can maintain the optimization characteristics of the population and have a high probability of obtaining Pareto solutions.

In WSNs, irregular and bursty traffic Leads to the congestion problem, which incites a decrease in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and increases packet loss as well as end-to-end delay. In the recent era, manifold efforts have been carried out to reduce network congestion however, these solutions have slow and premature optimization. To address optimization issues, this paper presents a self-adaptive source-sending rate optimization algorithm, which is a hybrid version of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) and Bifold-objective Proportional Integral Derivative (BPID) called N3-BPID. These techniques play a significant role in optimizing source rates to reduce network congestion. NSGA-III is a reference-based evolutionary approach, which dynamically configures the PID coefficients to get an optimal response. Furthermore, a novel bifold-objective fitness function is designed that balances the trade-offs between two PIDs performance indexes such as the Integral of Absolute Error and the Integral of Square Error. Due to simplicity and efficiency, an identically weighted aggregation mechanism is applied to ensemble both objectives into a single one. The proposed work is implemented to demonstrate a smart border surveillance application using Network Simulator v3 and compared with the state-of-the-art congestion control model Cuckoo Fuzzy PID (CFPID). The experimental result reveals that the proposed algorithm has significantly outperformed existing schemes in terms of PDR by 6.82%, packet loss by 24.52%, end-to-end delay by 15.31%, and queue length deviation by 8.93%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Congestion control; Genetic algorithm; NSGA-III; Wireless sensor network","Adaptive control systems; Congestion control (communication); Economic and social effects; Packet loss; Proportional control systems; Sensor nodes; Traffic congestion; Two term control systems; Congestion control; End to end delay; Network congestions; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Packet delivery ratio; Packets loss; Rate optimizations; Genetic algorithms","","","","Aimtongkham, Phet, Congestion Control and Prediction Schemes Using Fuzzy Logic System with Adaptive Membership Function in Wireless Sensor Networks, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2018, (2018); Mansouri, Najme, A multi-objective optimized replication using fuzzy based self-defense algorithm for cloud computing, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 171, (2020); Rashedi, Esmat, GSA: A Gravitational Search Algorithm, Information Sciences, 179, 13, pp. 2232-2248, (2009); Shah, Syed Afsar, Congestion control algorithms in wireless sensor networks: Trends and opportunities, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 29, 3, pp. 236-245, (2017); Fei, Zesong, A Survey of Multi-Objective Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks: Metrics, Algorithms, and Open Problems, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 19, 1, pp. 550-586, (2017); Bohloulzadeh, Atousa, A Survey on Congestion Control Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks, International Journal of Wireless Information Networks, 27, 3, pp. 365-384, (2020); Kaur, Gagandeep, A Green Hybrid Congestion Management Scheme for IoT-Enabled WSNs, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 6, 4, pp. 2144-2155, (2022); Int J Infonomics, (2010); Bhatti, Kabeer Ahmed, Progressive Fuzzy PSO-PID Congestion Control Algorithm for WSNs, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 48, 2, pp. 1157-1172, (2023); Lin, Lin, A novel fuzzy PID congestion control model based on cuckoo search in WSNs, Sensors, 20, 7, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","1569190X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197512628"

However, due to the limited IoT resources, it is intertwined with fog computing to use their resources to compensate for the limitations of IoT resources. On the other hand, fog devices face challenges, such as resource heterogeneity, high distribution, dynamism, and limitations, so an efficient task scheduling approach is needed to deploy fog computing resources effectively and improve the quality of service (QoS). This work mathematically formulates the task scheduling problem to minimize energy consumption and cost and improve QoS by reducing response time and deadline violation times of IoT tasks. Then, it proposes an Energy-efficient and deadline-Aware Task scheduling in Fog Computing (ETFC) method that predicts the traffic of fog nodes by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and divides them into low-traffic and high-traffic groups. Next, the ETFC method schedules the low-traffic part with an algorithm based on reinforcement learning using the proposed ICLA-SOA, which is an algorithm based on irregular cellular learning automata and schedules the tasks of the high-traffic part with a metaheuristic algorithm using the proposed Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). The simulation results demonstrate that the ETFC method exhibits up to an 84 % enhancement in response time, up to a 33 % reduction in energy consumption, up to a 30 % decrease in costs, and up to a 28 % advancement in meeting task deadlines compared to other methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deadline-aware; Energy consumption; Fog computing; Internet of things (IoT); Task scheduling","Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Fog; Fog computing; Genetic algorithms; Green computing; Internet of things; Multitasking; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling algorithms; Support vector machines; Computing resource; Deadline-aware; Energy consumption and cost; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Internet of thing; Quality-of-service; Resource heterogeneity; Task scheduling problem; Tasks scheduling; Energy utilization","","","","Seyfollahi, Ali, Reliable data dissemination for the Internet of Things using Harris hawks optimization, Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications, 13, 6, pp. 1886-1902, (2020); Cheng, Bo, Situation-Aware Dynamic Service Coordination in an IoT Environment, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 25, 4, pp. 2082-2095, (2017); Nematollahi, Masoud, Task offloading in Internet of Things based on the improved multi-objective aquila optimizer, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 18, 1, pp. 545-552, (2024); IEEE Trans Services Comput Early Access, (2020); Hou, Maojun, Optimal scheduling of the plug-in electric vehicles aggregator energy and regulation services based on grid to vehicle, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 27, 6, (2017); Deng, Zhaowen, A preview driver model based on sliding-mode and fuzzy control for articulated heavy vehicle, Meccanica, 57, 8, pp. 1853-1878, (2022); Cook, Jonathan, Security and Privacy for Low Power IoT Devices on 5G and Beyond Networks: Challenges and Future Directions, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 39295-39317, (2023); Khezri, Edris, DLJSF: Data-Locality Aware Job Scheduling IoT tasks in fog-cloud computing environments, Results in Engineering, 21, (2024); Lyu, Ting, Source Selection and Resource Allocation in Wireless-Powered Relay Networks: An Adaptive Dynamic Programming-Based Approach, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 11, 5, pp. 8973-8988, (2024); Int J Ind Electron Control Optim, (2022)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","22105379","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194409099"

Most of these multi-objective evolutionary techniques are population-based methods which usually work on random search approaches and often trapped into local minima during their execution. A new fuzzy tuned mayfly algorithm (FTMA) is presented in this paper, to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions for any complex multi-objective power system problem. It has a self-adapting global exploration capability to get the best Pareto-optimal solutions by varying two crucial parameters i.e., crossover (P<inf>c</inf>) and mutation P<inf>m</inf> probabilities. Moreover, a model of Pareto-dominance is employed to rank non-dominating solutions to maintain the diversity within the populations. The proposed evolutionary approach is examined on a standard ZDT benchmark test suite and its algorithmic performance is statistically compared with a few of the recent optimization techniques such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MMODE, MOAVOA and MMA algorithm. It is further applied to minimize two distinct objective functions (i.e., total transmission loss and voltage stability index) for IEEE-118 bus system and IEEE-24 bus RTS. A comprehensive statistical analysis is presented for the obtained numerical results, which proves that proposed FTMA has better convergence with better solution diversity in comparison to the other competing algorithms. A comprehensive analysis based on statistical results reveal that the proposed FTMA is superior for obtaining better non-dominating pareto-fronts as compared to other competing methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive evolutionary method; Fuzzy controller; Fuzzy Tuned Mayfly Algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Pareto-optimal solutions","Benchmarking; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Reactive power; Adaptive evolutionary method; Dispatch problems; Evolutionary method; Fuzzy controllers; Fuzzy tuned mayfly algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization of reactive power; Pareto optimal solutions; Reactive power dispatch; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Abou El-Ela, Adel A., Differential evolution algorithm for optimal reactive power dispatch, Electric Power Systems Research, 81, 2, pp. 458-464, (2011); Alsaç, Ongun, Optimal load flow with steady-state security, IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems, PAS-93, 3, pp. 745-751, (1974); Bai, Xiaoqing, Semidefinite programming for optimal power flow problems, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 30, 6-7, pp. 383-392, (2008); Basu, M., Multi-objective optimal reactive power dispatch using multi-objective differential evolution, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 82, pp. 213-224, (2016); Ben Oualid Medani, Khaled, Whale optimization algorithm based optimal reactive power dispatch: A case study of the Algerian power system, Electric Power Systems Research, 163, pp. 696-705, (2018); Chen, Gonggui, Optimal reactive power dispatch by improved GSA-based algorithm with the novel strategies to handle constraints, Applied Soft Computing, 50, pp. 58-70, (2017); Cura, Tunchan, A parallel mayfly algorithm for the α-neighbor p-center problem, Applied Soft Computing, 144, (2023); Dai, Chaohua, Reactive power dispatch considering voltage stability with seeker optimization algorithm, Electric Power Systems Research, 79, 10, pp. 1462-1471, (2009); Dai, Chaohua, Seeker optimization algorithm for optimal reactive power dispatch, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 24, 3, pp. 1218-1231, (2009); Complex Systems, (1995)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189540784"

Findings: (1) The conflicting relationship among the three optimization objectives was analyzed for various failure modes of EAMs. (2) For different EMAs' failure modes, the multi-objective optimization configuration strategy can simultaneously achieve the optimal or sub-optimal effective EMF, flux margins, and stability of EMF. Moreover, the characteristics of the optimal Pareto front are consistent with the physical properties of the AMB. (3) Compared with the feasible configuration of C0, the non-inferior configurations can significantly improve the performance of AMB, and the advantages of the multi-objective optimization configuration strategy become more prominent as the asymmetry of the residual supporting structure intensifies. Originality/value: i) Considering the variation of the rotor displacement during the support reconstruction, a decision-making model that can accurately characterize the dynamic performance of AMB is presented. (ii) The interaction law between AMB and rotor under different failure modes of EMAs is analyzed, and the configuration principles for redundant EMAs are proposed. (iii) Based on the dynamic characteristics of AMB during the support reconstruction, effective EMF, energy consumption, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the desired EMFs and the decoupled control currents are used as objective functions. iv. The NSGA-III is combined with the decision-making model to address the multi-objective optimization configuration problem of C0. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active magnetic bearing (AMB); Electromagnetic actuators (EMAs); Multi-objective optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm","Correlation methods; Decision making; Electric actuators; Electromagnets; Energy utilization; Failure modes; Fault tolerance; Genetic algorithms; Magnetic actuators; Numerical methods; Active magnetic bearing; Decision-making modeling; Electromagnetic actuator; Electromagnetic actuators; Faults tolerant controls; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work is partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 52275065 and partly by the National Key R&D Program of China with Grant No. 2018YFB2000103.","Aenis, M., Active magnetic bearings for the identification and fault diagnosis in turbomachinery, Mechatronics, 12, 8, pp. 1011-1021, (2002); Cheng, Xin, An Accurate Linearization of Electromagnetic Force of Heteropolar Magnetic Bearings with Redundant Structures, Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, 142, 9, (2020); Cheng, Xin, Optimization of bias current coefficient in the fault-tolerance of active magnetic bearings based on the redundant structure parameters, Automatika, 61, 4, pp. 602-613, (2020); Cheng, Xin, Design and Implementation of a Fault-Tolerant Magnetic Bearing Control System Combined with a Novel Fault-Diagnosis of Actuators, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 2454-2465, (2021); Cole, Matthew Owen Thomas, Towards fault-tolerant active control of rotor-magnetic bearing systems, Control Engineering Practice, 12, 4, pp. 491-501, (2004); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Elarbi, Maha, A New Decomposition-Based NSGA-II for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 48, 7, pp. 1191-1210, (2018); Hutterer, Markus, Stabilization of a Magnetically Levitated Rotor in the Case of a Defective Radial Actuator, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 25, 6, pp. 2599-2609, (2020); Jain, Himanshu, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point based nondominated sorting approach, Part II: Handling constraints and extending to an adaptive approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 602-622, (2014)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02644401","","ENCOE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197794508"

However, various factors influence the motor’s structural parameters, leading to uncertainties in its NVH performance. To improve the motor’s NVH characteristics, we propose a method for optimizing the structural parameters of automotive micro-motors under uncertain conditions. This method uses the motor’s maximum magnetic flux as a constraint and aims to reduce vibration at the commutation frequency. Firstly, we introduce the Pareto ellipsoid parameter method, which converts the uncertainty problem into a deterministic one, enabling the use of traditional optimization methods. To increase efficiency and reduce computational cost, we employed a data-driven method that uses the one-dimensional Inception module as the foundational model, replacing both numerical models and physical experiments. Simultaneously, the module’s underlying architecture was improved, increasing the surrogate model’s accuracy. Additionally, we propose an improved NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) method that utilizes adaptive reference point updating, dividing the optimization process into exploration and refinement phases based on population matching error. Comparative experiments with traditional models demonstrate that this method enhances the overall quality of the solution set, effectively addresses parameter uncertainties in practical engineering scenarios, and significantly improves the vibration characteristics of the motor. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data-driven; motor’s NVH; optimization; parameter uncertainty; Pareto ellipsoid parameter method","","","","This study was funded by the Talent Program (Ph.D. Fund) of Chengdu Technological University [grant number 2024RC025], the Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province [grant number 2022NSFSC1892], and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number XJ2021KJZK054].","Zhao, Ting, Adaptive Multi-Feature Fusion for Vehicle Micro-Motor Noise Recognition Considering Auditory Perception, Sound and Vibration, 57, 1, pp. 133-153, (2023); Li, Zhihui, Review of design optimization methods for turbomachinery aerodynamics, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 93, pp. 1-23, (2017); Wang, Yansong, Electromagnetic noise analysis and optimization for permanent magnet synchronous motor used on electric vehicles, Engineering Computations, 38, 2, pp. 699-719, (2021); Lin, Fu, Reduction of vibration and acoustic noise in permanent magnet synchronous motor by optimizing magnetic forces, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 429, pp. 193-205, (2018); Islam, Mohammad Sariful, Noise and vibration characteristics of permanent-magnet synchronous motors using electromagnetic and structural analyses, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 50, 5, pp. 3214-3222, (2014); Gajek, Jakub, Mathematical models and nonlinear dynamics of a linear electromagnetic motor, Nonlinear Dynamics, 94, 1, pp. 377-396, (2018); Nejadpak, Arash, Physics-based modeling of power converters from finite element electromagnetic field computations, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 49, 1, pp. 567-576, (2013); Wu, Yichang, Magnetic field analysis of a coaxial magnetic gear mechanism by two-dimensional equivalent magnetic circuit network method and finite-element method, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 39, 19, pp. 5746-5758, (2015); Xu, Jie, Simulation, Verification and Optimization Design of Electromagnetic Vibration and Noise of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor for Vehicle, Energies, 15, 16, (2022); Gundogmus, Omer, Acoustic Noise Mitigation of Switched Reluctance Machines with Windows on Stator and Rotor Poles, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 56, 4, pp. 3719-3730, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20751702","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202611624"

This complexity is further compounded by the interdependent nature of the structural elements, which necessitates a comprehensive optimization approach. Addressing this challenge is crucial for advancing construction practices and improving the efficiency and safety of structural designs. The integration of advanced optimization algorithms and decision-making techniques offers a promising avenue for enhancing the design process of prestressed arched trusses. This study proposes the use of three advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms: NSGA-III, CTAEA, and SMS-EMOA, to optimize the structural design of prestressed arched trusses. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated using generational distance and inverted generational distance metrics. Additionally, the non-dominated optimal designs generated by these algorithms were assessed and ranked using multiple multi-criteria decision-making techniques, including SAW, FUCA, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, and VIKOR. This approach allowed for a robust comparison of the algorithms and provided insights into their effectiveness in balancing the different design objectives. The results of the study indicated that NSGA-III exhibited superior performance with a GD value of 0.215, reflecting a closer proximity of its solutions to the Pareto front, and an IGD value of 0.329, indicating a well-distributed set of solutions across the Pareto front. In comparison, CTAEA and SMS-EMOA showed higher GD values of 0.326 and 0.436, respectively, suggesting less convergence to the Pareto front. However, SMS-EMOA demonstrated a balanced performance in terms of constructability and structural weight, with an IGD value of 0.434. The statistical significance of these differences was confirmed by the Kruskal–Wallis test, with p-values of (Formula presented.) for GD and (Formula presented.) for IGD. These findings underscore the advantages and limitations of each algorithm, providing valuable insights for future applications in structural optimization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CTAEA; FUCA; multi-criteria decision-making; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; PROMETHEE; SAW; SMS-EMOA; TOPSIS; VIKOR","","","","Grant PID2023-150003OB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by \u201CERDF A way of making Europe\u201D.

Many variants of the VRP have been proposed. However, few studies on VRP have combined robustness and just-in-time (JIT) requirements with uncertainty. To solve the problem, this paper proposes the just-in-time-based robust multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows (JIT-RMOVRPTW) for the assembly workshop. Based on the conflict between uncertain time and JIT requirements, a JIT strategy was proposed. To measure the robustness of the solution, a metric was designed as the objective. Afterwards, a two-stage nondominated sorting ant colony algorithm with deep reinforcement learning (NSACOWDRL) was proposed. In stage I, ACO combines with NSGA-III to obtain the Pareto frontier. Based on the model, a pheromone update strategy and a transfer probability formula were designed. DDQN was introduced as a local search algorithm which trains networks through Pareto solutions to participate in probabilistic selection and nondominated sorting. In stage II, the Pareto frontier was quantified in feasibility by Monte Carlo simulation, and tested by diversity-robust selection based on uniformly distributed weights in the solution space to select robust Pareto solutions that take diversity into account. The effectiveness of NSACOWDRL was demonstrated through comparative experiments with other algorithms on instances. The impact of JIT strategy is analyzed and the effect of networks on the NSACOWDRL is further discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ACO; DRL; multiobjective problem; robust; VRP","Ant colony optimization; Deep learning; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Pareto principle; Reinforcement learning; ACO; Ant colonies algorithm; DRL; Just-in-time; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Non-dominated Sorting; Reinforcement learnings; Robust; Vehicle Routing Problems; Deep reinforcement learning","","","This research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province, China under the Grant Nos.

The simulation results show that a task offloading scheme based on MOEA/D is obviously superior to the above schemes in terms of offloading delay, energy consumption and load balancing, and can provide efficient and energy-saving offloading service. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Delay; Energy consumption; Internet of vehicles (IoV); Load Balancing; MOEA/D; Offloading decision","Energy efficiency; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Multiobjective optimization; Vehicles; Delay; Energy savings; Energy-consumption; Energy-savings; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of vehicle; Load-Balancing; MOEA/D; Offloading decision; Task offloading; Energy utilization","","","This project was supported by Tianjin Natural Science Foundation General Project (22JCZDJC00600).","Gerla, Mario, Internet of vehicles: From intelligent grid to autonomous cars and vehicular clouds, pp. 241-246, (2014); Al-Sultan, Saif, A comprehensive survey on vehicular Ad Hoc network, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 37, 1, pp. 380-392, (2014); Computer Research and Development, (2019); Zhao, Ziming, Edge Computing: Platforms, Applications and Challenges, Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan/Computer Research and Development, 55, 2, pp. 327-337, (2018); Mach, Pavel J., Mobile Edge Computing: A Survey on Architecture and Computation Offloading, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 19, 3, pp. 1628-1656, (2017); Mao, Sun, Energy-Efficient Cooperative Communication and Computation for Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing, IEEE Systems Journal, 16, 1, pp. 287-298, (2022); Malandrino, Francesco, The role of parked cars in content downloading for vehicular networks, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 63, 9, pp. 4606-4617, (2014); In IEEE 11th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Wcsp Xian China, (2013); Dai, Yueyue, Edge Intelligence for Energy-Efficient Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in 5G beyond, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 69, 10, pp. 12175-12186, (2020); Pham, Quoc Viet, Decentralized computation offloading and resource allocation for mobile-edge computing: A matching game approach, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 75868-75885, (2018)","","Springer","","","","","","1572834X; 09296212","","WPCOF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200051692"

Traditional approaches struggle with this balance, leading to suboptimal solution distributions in the objective space especially at higher number of objectives. This necessitates the need for innovative strategies to adeptly manage these complexities. This study introduces a Many-Objective Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (MaOAHA), an advanced evolutionary algorithm designed to overcome the limitations of existing many-objective optimization methods. The objectives are to improve convergence rates, maintain solution diversity, and achieve a uniform distribution in the objective space. MaOAHA implements information feedback mechanism (IFM), reference point-based selection and association, non-dominated sorting, and niche preservation. The IFM utilizes historical data from previous generations to inform the update process, thereby improving the algorithm's the exploration and exploitation capabilities. Reference point-based selection, along with non-dominated sorting, ensures solutions are both close to the Pareto front and evenly spread in the objective space. Niche preservation and density estimation strategies are employed to maintain diversity and prevent overcrowding. The comprehensive experimental analysis benchmarks MaOAHA against four leading algorithms viz. Many-Objective Gradient-Based Optimizer, Many-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizer, Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm, and Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III. The DTLZ1-DTLZ7 benchmark sets with four, six, and eight objectives and five real-world problems (RWMaOP1-RWMaOP5) are considered for performance assessment of the selected algorithms. The results demonstrate that internal parameter-free MaOAHA significantly outperforms its counterparts, achieving better generational distance by up to 52.38%, inverse generational distance by up to 38.09%, spacing by up to 56%, spread by up to 71.42%, hypervolume by up to 44%, and runtime by up to 52%. These metrics affirm the MaOAHA's capability to enhance the decision-making processes through its adept balance of convergence, diversity, and uniformity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial hummingbird algorithm; diversity preservation; many-objective optimization; multi-objective optimization; non-dominated sorting","Balancing; Benchmarking; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Screening; Artificial hummingbird algorithm; Diversity preservation; Feedback mechanisms; Information feedback; Many-objective optimizations; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated Sorting; Objective space; Point-based; Reference points; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; detection method; experimental study; instrumentation; optimization","","","This article was supported by the project Students Grant Competi-Tion SP2024/087, \""Specific Research of Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies\"", financed by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic and Faculty of Mechanical Engineering V\u0160B-TUO","Many Criteria Optimization and Decision Analysis State of the Art Present Challenges and Future Perspectives, (2023); Ahmad, Naseer, Multi-objective optimization in the development of oil and water repellent cellulose fabric based on response surface methodology and the desirability function, Materials Research Express, 4, 3, (2017); Bradstreet, Lucas, A fast incremental hypervolume algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 12, 6, pp. 714-723, (2008); Cao, Bin, Many-Objective Deployment Optimization for a Drone-Assisted Camera Network, IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering, 8, 4, pp. 2756-2764, (2021); Cao, Bin, Mobility-Aware Multiobjective Task Offloading for Vehicular Edge Computing in Digital Twin Environment, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 41, 10, pp. 3046-3055, (2023); Cao, Bin, Applying graph-based differential grouping for multiobjective large-scale optimization, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 53, (2020); Chen, Huangke, Hyperplane Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization Problems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 50, 7, pp. 3367-3380, (2020); Chen, Yensheng Sheng, Performance enhancement of multiband antennas through a two-stage optimization technique, International Journal of RF and Microwave Computer-Aided Engineering, 27, 2, (2017); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016); Cheraghalipour, Armin, Tree Growth Algorithm (TGA): A novel approach for solving optimization problems, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 72, pp. 393-414, (2018)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","22885048; 22884300","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198749434"

Design, being an innovation-driven domain, demands greater flexibility in resource allocation. Consequently, rapidly and effectively allocating cloud service resources for personalized design tasks becomes crucial. With the emergence of the Industrial Metaverse, which blurs the boundaries between real and virtual design and manufacturing, it is gaining increasing attention. To embrace the advent of Industry 5.0 and the Industrial Metaverse, swift collaborative cloud services for design and manufacturing resources are essential. In this context, this article introduces a novel approach combining complex networks with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), aimed at rapidly optimizing the dynamic allocation of distributed design resources (DRs). Initially, a multipartite graph is created from raw data and mapped to multiple bipartite graphs to identify key nodes in the network through intersection. Subsequently, these key nodes are used as reference points in the NSGA-III algorithm to achieve high-quality cloud service combinations, meeting the needs of design tasks with multiple subtasks, and related multi-objective optimization, including time, cost, reliability, maintainability, and reputation associated with the design. Finally, the Pareto service combinations obtained are used to construct a new complex network and employ the Girvan-Newman algorithm based on edge betweenness to identify community structures. In case of anomalies in the best service combination, alternative options can be swiftly searched from the identified communities, thereby enhancing the resilience of the cloud service process. Experimental results demonstrate the method's advantages in recovery and robustness, contributing significantly to the optimization of rapid cloud service allocation for DRs in the context of Industry 5.0. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complex network; Design community; Industry 5.0; NSGA-III; Resource allocation","Complex networks; Distributed database systems; Genetic algorithms; Graph theory; Resource allocation; Cloud services; Design community; Design resources; Design tasks; Industry 5.0; Metaverses; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Resources allocation; Services combinations; Multiobjective optimization","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2024A1515011048 and 2022A1515010095), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Royal Society of Edinburgh (51911530245).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2022A1515010095), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Royal Society of Edinburgh (51911530245).","Alexopoulos, Kosmas, A quantitative approach to resilience in manufacturing systems, International Journal of Production Research, 60, 24, pp. 7178-7193, (2022); Bipartite Graphs and their Applications, (1998); Bhamu, Jaiprakash, Lean manufacturing: Literature review and research issues, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 34, 7, pp. 876-940, (2014); Bi, Xiaoxue, A preference-based multi-objective algorithm for optimal service composition selection in cloud manufacturing, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 33, 8, pp. 751-768, (2020); International Journal of Operations and Production Management, (1986); Cheng, Ying, Advanced manufacturing systems: supply–demand matching of manufacturing resource based on complex networks and Internet of Things, Enterprise Information Systems, 12, 7, pp. 780-797, (2018); Cheng, Ying, Modeling of manufacturing service supply–demand matching hypernetwork in service-oriented manufacturing systems, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 45, pp. 59-72, (2017); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Ding, Shuhui, Multistage Cloud-Service Matching and Optimization Based on Hierarchical Decomposition of Design Tasks, Machines, 10, 9, (2022); Girvan, Michelle, Community structure in social and biological networks, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99, 12, pp. 7821-7826, (2002)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01663615","","CINUD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194402141"

This will further lead to the occurrence of secondary disasters, resulting in serious human and economic losses. This study focuses on solving the cooperative regulation problem of non-stationary ventilation networks (NSVNs) after a disaster. The NSVN solution model is dynamically combined with the ventilation network regulation method to simulate the results of post-disaster cooperative regulation. The Pareto optimal solution for decision variables is obtained with the goals of reducing the affected area, preventing the reversal of branch airflow, and rapidly discharging the high concentration of gas. In this regard, an NSGA-III algorithm based on segmented hybrid coding with conditional distribution sampling is designed to solve the problem of the population crossover operation under the dynamic change of the decision variables. In addition, according to the applicability of the decision variables in the regulation of NSVNs, the sampling distribution function that meets the practical application requirements is selected. Moreover, conditional distribution sampling is carried out for chromosome generation via real number coding, the aim of which is to improve the search efficiency and optimization effect. Via the hierarchical logical relationship between the decision variables, conversion is carried out to generate population individuals of different dimensions to realize the dynamic inputs of the NSVN solution model and calculate the corresponding target values. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model and solution method is verified by studying and analyzing the case of an airflow disaster in a coal mine in Jiulishan, China. This study provides theoretical support for the cooperative regulation of NSVNs, as well as guidance for the post-disaster emergency rescue work in possible coal and gas herniation accidents. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coal and gas outburst; Gas flow disaster; Multi-objective optimization; Regulation; Ventilation network","Coal; Coal mines; Decision making; Disasters; Distribution functions; Flow of gases; Gas bursts; Gases; Losses; Pareto principle; Coal and gas outburst; Cooperative regulation; Decision variables; Gas flow disaster; Multi-objectives optimization; Network solutions; Nonstationary; Regulation; Solution model; Ventilation network; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported by the Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52121003 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52130409 ) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 8222070 ).","Chen, Hong, Research on 10-year tendency of China coal mine accidents and the characteristics of human factors, Safety Science, 50, 4, pp. 745-750, (2012); Rahimi, Shokofe, Investigating the impact of gas emission uncertainty on airflow distribution in an auxiliary ventilation system using CFD and Monte-Carlo simulation, Building and Environment, 204, (2021); Zhou, Aitao, Effects of fast-desorbed gas on the propagation characteristics of outburst shock waves and gas flows in underground roadways, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 119, pp. 295-303, (2018); Wang, Kai, Experimental study on propagation law of shock wave and airflow induced by coal and gas outburst in mine ventilation network, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 151, pp. 299-310, (2021); Zhou, Aitao, A transient model for airflow stabilization induced by gas accumulations in a mine ventilation network, Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 47, pp. 104-109, (2017); Zhou, Aitao, Airflow disturbance induced by coal mine outburst shock waves: A case study of a gas outburst disaster in China, International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 128, (2020); Lei, Baiwei, A study on source identification of gas explosion in coal mines based on gas concentration, Fuel, 290, (2021); Liu, Wei, Influence of cavity structure on gas explosion characteristics in coal mine, Powder Technology, 398, (2022); Wang, Chenghao, Role of coal deformation energy in coal and gas outburst: A review, Fuel, 332, (2023); Wang, Haiyan, Experimental study on effect of dilute coal dust on gas explosion pressure/flame evolution process, Powder Technology, 404, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","14740346","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188097553"

Learning from data is often seen as a tradeoff between these two risks. Additionally, balancing training error and validation error can overcome the overfitting problem to some extent. It is known that the network performance is also related to regularization term. In order to consider four factors, i.e. training error, validation error, network complexity and regularization term simultaneously in the training process of a single-hidden layer feedforword neural network (SLFN), a many-objective coevolutionary learning algorithm (MOCELA) integrated with extreme learning machine auto-encoder (ELMAE), called MOCELA-ELMAE is presented. In MOCELA, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is improved for handling the many-objective optimization model with hybrid variables, where binary coding is used for structure learning and real coding is utilized for representing input parameters, referring to all input weights and hidden biases of the AE network. Output parameters of AE, i.e. output weights are analytically calculated by the non-iterative learning rule. The network structure and connection parameters of SLFN are determined based on those of AE. A set of Pareto optimal solutions are eventually collected by the MOCELA-ELMAE, which represents multiple optimal SLFNs. To make the final decision, three best SLFNs with minimum validation errors are selected as the base classifiers for selective ensemble learning. Extensive experiments are implemented on the benchmark classification data sets of UCI machine learning repository, and obvious improvements have been observed when the proposed MOCELA-ELMAE is compared with the NSGA-III based on hybrid coding and completely non-iterative learning of SLFN respectively. The experimental results also illustrate that the MOCELA-ELMAE performs much better than other state-of-the-art learning algorithms on many data sets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Ensemble learning; Extreme learning machine auto-encoder; Many-objective learning algorithm; Structure optimization","Balancing; Complex networks; Errors; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Pareto principle; Structural optimization; Auto encoders; Co-evolutionary learning; Ensemble learning; Extreme learning machine auto-encoder; Hidden layers; Learning machines; Many-objective learning algorithm; Structure optimization; Training errors; Validation errors; Classification (of information)","","","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Program Nos. 2022JM-372 and 2022JQ-670 ), in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61966030 , 61772391 , and 62106186 ).","Adra, Salem Fawaz, Convergence acceleration operator for multiobjective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 13, 4, pp. 825-847, (2009); Anandhakumar, C., Extreme learning machine model with honey badger algorithm based state-of-charge estimation of lithium-ion battery, Expert Systems with Applications, 238, (2024); Bao, Chunteng, A new adaptive decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for multi- and many-objective optimization, Expert Systems with Applications, 213, (2023); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Breiman, Leo, Stacked regressions, Machine Learning, 24, 1, pp. 49-64, (1996); Cai, Yaoming, Extreme learning machine based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 791, pp. 420-435, (2017); Cao, Weipeng, A review on neural networks with random weights, Neurocomputing, 275, pp. 278-287, (2018); Choudhary, Roshani, A clustering based ensemble of weighted kernelized extreme learning machine for class imbalance learning, Expert Systems with Applications, 164, (2021); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182607203"

In other words, the goal is to place homogeneous virtual machines (VMs) on the physical host according to performance criteria such as energy consumption, resource wastage, and utilization. virtual machine placement (VMP) falls into NP-hard knapsack problems. To overcome the time complexity, the use of heuristic and metaheuristic methods has attracted the attention of researchers. In this paper, we use an entropy-based method for VMP for the first time. The proposed method tries to place the VMs on physical machines by considering the type of VMs to minimize entropy. Entropy is a measurable property that is more associated with disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. We use one of the most common entropy criteria called the Gini coefficient. In summary, among the different placement combinations of VMs, those that can minimize the Gini coefficient are preferred. We then solve the multi-objective problem with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III).

The model employs a multi-objective optimization framework, focusing primarily on minimizing resource scheduling time and reducing costs. It incorporates critical factors such as spatial location, network topology, station size, and passenger flow. A hybrid method, combining the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, is used to solve the model, with its effectiveness confirmed through a case study of the Nanjing Metro system. The simulation results yielded an optimal number of 21 maintenance resource supply stations and provided their placement. In the event of large-scale failures, the optimal resource scheduling strategy ensures demand satisfaction rates exceed 90% at critical stations, maintaining an overall rate of 87.09%, therefore significantly improving resource scheduling efficiency and the system’s emergency response capabilities and enhancing the physical resilience and recovery capabilities of the urban metro system. Moreover, the model accounts for economic factors, striving to balance emergency response capabilities with production continuity and cost efficiency through effective maintenance strategies and resource utilization.

This study aims to analyze the effects of different water and fertilizer combinations on the summer maize yield, water-use efficiency, and field N<inf>2</inf>O flux and to determine the optimal water and fertilizer application scheme for summer maize. Field experiments were conducted in 2023, with a total of 15 different combinations of upper and lower limits of irrigation and fertilizer levels. A binary quadratic regression model based on the yield, water-use efficiency, and N<inf>2</inf>O emission flux was constructed. The fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) was employed for verification and solution finding to simulate the optimal water and fertilizer regime. The results indicate that with increasing water and fertilizer applications, the field N<inf>2</inf>O emission flux gradually increases. The summer maize yield and water-use efficiency show a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing. Compared to fertilization, irrigation has a more significant impact on the summer maize yield and water-use efficiency, while fertilization notably influences the field N<inf>2</inf>O emission flux to a greater extent. Using NSGA-III, the simulated optimal water and fertilizer combination showed no significant difference in the yield and water-use efficiency compared to the actual optimal water–fertilizer irrigation combination (moderate water and moderate fertilizer), with a 3.12% increase in the field N<inf>2</inf>O emission flux, a 15.30% decrease in the irrigation amount, and an 11.90% reduction in the fertilizer application. In conclusion, employing the optimized water and fertilizer combination can reduce agricultural irrigation and fertilization while ensuring crop yields, providing theoretical support for the green, efficient, and sustainable development of the summer maize industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","effect analysis; N2O emission flux in farmlands; summer maize; water-use efficiency; water–fertilizer coupling","agricultural emission; agricultural land; crop yield; fertilizer application; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; irrigation system; maize; nitrous oxide; summer; water use efficiency","","","This research was supported by the Key R & D projects in Henan Province (241111112600), the North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power \u2018double first-class\u2019 innovation team project (CXTDPY-8), and this project was supported by a special fund of the Henan Key Laboratory of Water Pollution Control and Rehabilitation Technology (CJSZ2024008).

Here we demonstrate how evolutionary multiobjective optimization techniques can be adapted to provide such an approach. With the established Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) as the optimization framework, we use AlphaFold2 and ProteinMPNN confidence metrics to define the objective space, and a mutation operator composed of ESM-1v and ProteinMPNN to rank and then redesign the least favorable positions. Using the two-state design problem of the foldswitching protein RfaH as an in-depth case study, and PapD and calmodulin as examples of higher-dimensional design problems, we show that the evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach leads to significant reduction in the bias and variance in RfaH native sequence recovery, compared to a direct application of ProteinMPNN. We suggest that this improvement is due to three factors: (i) the use of an informative mutation operator that accelerates the sequence space exploration, (ii) the parallel, iterative design process inherent to the genetic algorithm that improves upon the ProteinMPNN autoregressive sequence decoding scheme, and (iii) the explicit approximation of the Pareto front that leads to optimal design candidates representing diverse tradeoff conditions. We anticipate this approach to be readily adaptable to different models and broadly relevant for protein design tasks with complex specifications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Approximation algorithms; Deep learning; Design; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Pareto principle; Space research; Computational protein design; Design problems; Design-process; Direct integration; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Modeling functions; Multi-objectives optimization; Mutation operators; Objective functions; Protein sequence design; Multiobjective optimization; calcineurin; calmodulin; chaperone; chaperone protein PapD; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; neurotrophin receptor p75; RfaH protein; sodium channel Nav1.5; transcription factor; unclassified drug; protein; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; amino terminal sequence; Article; beta sheet; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; design; entropy; Escherichia coli; genetic algorithm; hydrogen bond; machine learning; multiobjective optimization; mutation; mutation rate; phenotype; principal component analysis; protein sequence design; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; sequence entropy; structural model; algorithm; bioinformatics; chemistry; genetics; procedures; protein engineering; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Computational Biology; Protein Engineering; Proteins; Sequence Analysis, Protein","","calcineurin, 137951-12-3; endothelial nitric oxide synthase, 503473-02-7; protein, 67254-75-5; Proteins","This work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (R35 GM145236 to T.K.).

In this problem, a fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are equipped with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform delivery and pickup services within the customers’ time windows. The UAV is capable of performing pickup operations after the delivery service, as long as it does not exceed its energy capacity. The HFCV can launch and retrieve the UAV multiple times as needed throughout the routing process. We establish a mixed integer programming model to simultaneously minimize the total cost and makespan, and verify its accuracy by Gurobi. To tackle larger-scale instances, we propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III with intelligent selection (NSGA-III-IS). The initial population is generated using four distinct approaches aimed at enhancing both diversity and quality. Considering the customers’ time windows, we factor in the temporal-spatial distances between customers when generating the initial population. Our approach employs a two-phase algorithm for developing initial solutions. In the first phase, the algorithm focuses on generating UAV trips, while in the second phase, it creates joint delivery routes for both the HFCV and the UAV. To enhance the optimization process, we have developed four strategies for optimizing UAV speed. These strategies dynamically adjust the UAV's speed in response to the customers’ time windows and the HFCVs’ arrival times. Additionally, we have integrated an intelligent selection mechanism to optimize the execution probabilities of both general and problem-specific operators. The experimental results demonstrate the following: (1) The proposed NSGA-III-IS outperforms other variant algorithms and two benchmark algorithms; (2) UAVs significantly benefit from variable flight speeds, resulting in reduced costs and improved efficiency; (3) The HFCV with UAV joint delivery pattern is superior for reducing carbon emissions compared to other joint delivery patterns; (4) Longer customer time windows and optimized UAV speed strategies are effective in reducing the total cost, makespan, and total UAV hover waiting time; (5) Finally, a method that combines multi-attribute decision-making with principal component analysis is utilized to aid decision-makers in selecting satisfactory solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-attribute decision-making; Time windows; Time-dependent speed; Variable drone speeds","Antennas; Decision making; Fleet operations; Fuel cells; Genetic algorithms; Hydrogen; Integer programming; Principal component analysis; Sales; Vehicle routing; Aerial vehicle; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Makespan; Multi attribute decision making; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Time dependent; Time dependent speed; Time windows; Variable drone speed; Vehicle Routing Problems; Pickups","","","","Aïder, Méziane, The ɛ-constraint as a learning strategy in the population-based algorithm: The case of Bi-Objective Obnoxious p-Median Problems, Knowledge-Based Systems, 265, (2023); Amine Masmoudi, M., Vehicle routing problems with drones equipped with multi-package payload compartments, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 164, (2022); Bi, Xiaowen, Logistical Planning for Electric Vehicles under Time-Dependent Stochastic Traffic, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 20, 10, pp. 3771-3781, (2019); Bogyrbayeva, Aigerim, A deep reinforcement learning approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 148, (2023); Campuzano, Giovanni, The drone-assisted variable speed asymmetric traveling salesman problem, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 176, (2023); undefined, (2016); Damoah, Isaac Sakyi, Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced medical drones in the healthcare supply chain (HSC) for sustainability development: A case study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 328, (2021); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1917, pp. 849-858, (2000); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Di Puglia Pugliese, Luigi, Last-Mile Deliveries by Using Drones and Classical Vehicles, Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics, 217, pp. 557-565, (2017)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196972983"

For the first time in the design of this type of transformer, harmonics of the power grid affecting the transformer design, along with all design variables, are included, and their boundaries suitable for the production line are determined. The design probability (search space) for a total of 21 design variables is 1.32×1025. The Brute Force method is not a time-efficient approach to finding the optimal result in this search space. Due to the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) nature of the transformer design problem, heuristic optimization algorithms are selected because of their shorter solution time and near-optimal results. Considering the principle of the “No Free Lunch” theorem, extensive evaluations were conducted on various heuristic algorithms to identify the most effective ones for addressing the transformer design problem. The most successful algorithms for solving the problem were identified after thorough evaluation, considering three distinct scenarios within a multi-objective optimization framework. These algorithms are namely MOEA/D, MOGWO, MOWOA, and NSGA III. In this study, an optimization tool is developed for the design optimization of hermetically sealed distribution transformers, covering a range from 50 kVA to 3150 kVA and encompassing all design variables. The developed optimization program is fully compatible with the production line and can be easily adjusted to meet all national and international standards, such as IEC and IEEE, as well as customer specifications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Design optimization; Distribution transformer; Energy efficiency; Multi-objective optimization","","","","This work was supported in part by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\u00DCB\u0130TAK) ; and in part by the Research and Development Department, Elta\u015F Transformat\u00F6r A.\u015E. , under Grant Number 119C127 .","Spotlight on Modern Transformer Design, (2009); undefined, (2009); Petkovska, Lidija B., A novel approach to multi-objective efficiency optimisation for a distribution transformer based on the Taguchi method, pp. 2228-2234, (2014); Mohammed, Mohammed Sami, NSGA-II+FEM Based Loss Optimization of Three-Phase Transformer, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 66, 9, pp. 7417-7425, (2019); Khatri, Ajay, Optimal design of power transformer using genetic algorithm, pp. 830-833, (2012); Hashemi, Mohammad Hassan, Applications of Novel Heuristic Algorithms in Design Optimization of Energy-Efficient Distribution Transformer, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 15968-15980, (2023); Hashemi, Mohammad Hassan, Hybrid Heuristic and Pattern Search Optimization Algorithm for Design Optimization of Energy Efficient Distribution Transformer, pp. 329-334, (2022); Tamilselvi, S., Evolutionary algorithm-based design optimization for right choice of transformer conductor material and stepped core, Electrical Engineering, 101, 1, pp. 259-277, (2019); Tören, Murat, Optimization of transformer parameters at distribution and power levels with hybrid Grey wolf-whale optimization algorithm, Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal, 43, (2023); Olivares-Galván, Juan Carlos, Design of a Three-Phase Shell-Type Distribution Transformer Using Evolutionary Algorithms, Energies, 16, 10, (2023)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22150986","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196278398"

However, the sampling process for building high-precision surrogate models requires a large number of sample points, resulting in high modeling costs for other regions. Moreover, the selection of Pareto fronts often relies solely on the magnitudes of objective values, without considering the uncertainties associated with the information. To address these issues, this research proposes a novel multi-objective optimization method for injection molding process parameters, using hierarchical sampling and integrated entropy weighting. The method introduces a unique hierarchical sampling approach to enhance the accuracy of the surrogate model in injection molding, with a specific focus on critical components. Additionally, our method incorporates entropy calculations for multiple objective defect value parameters during the multi-objective optimization process, enhancing the rationality of the optimization process. The proposed method is utilized to optimize the injection molding parameters of a thin-walled propeller blade. The result shows that our surrogate model fits well and exhibits superior performance compared to the response surface method in optimizing multiple objectives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comprehensive entropy weight; Gaussian interpolation; Hierarchical sampling; Model refinement; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III","Entropy; Injection molding; Thin walled structures; Comprehensive entropy weight; Entropy weights; Gaussian interpolation; Hierarchical sampling; Injection molding process; Model refinement; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-III; Process parameters; Surrogate modeling; Multiobjective optimization","","","The authors would like to thank the project funded by Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province (2022C01185).","German, R.

Many of these aspects, in the real context of a cattle farm, are not considered, and most of the farmers’ decisions are based on their experiences. In this proposal, we establish a many-objective optimization model for rotational grazing allocation based on six objectives that consider cattle weight gain and travel, as well as their welfare. The model is solved using the NSGA-III algorithm, and its performance is evaluated using a simulation study of 90 days of rotational grazing in which it is compared with the traditional grazing strategy. Average weight gains of up to 36.7 kg per animal are achieved at the end of the three months of simulated grazing using the proposed model. The results indicate that the allocation model generates an average weight gain that is statistically greater than that generated by the traditional rotation method but also guarantees improved animal welfare, the main contribution of our approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal welfare; Artificial intelligence; Many-objective optimization; Precision livestock farming; Rotational grazing","Farms; Animal health; Animal welfare; Innate behaviours; Many-objective optimizations; Multidimensional nature; Optimization approach; Optimization models; Precision livestock farming; Rotational grazing; Weight gain; Animals","","","Marvin Jimenez is supported by a PhD grant financed by Universidad EAFIT, Colombia.

It can bring convenience to system deployment, operation, and maintenance. This article considers the implementation of AI-based IoT applications based on Docker and container technology in a cloud-edge collaborative environment. Three typical data-intensive applications, preprocessing, training, and inference in machine learning, are deployed using Docker containers. For these three types of tasks, this article proposes a container-based data-intensive application scheduling framework. Using an attribute-based data-driven method, a new scheduling approach considering multiple weighting factors is proposed, which is called DICS-OPT. The cloud nodes and edge nodes are scored and sorted uniformly. The container is scheduled to the node with the highest score, and then the task data is transmitted to the node to execute the task. NSGA-III-based genetic algorithm has been proposed to search for the optimal weighting factors. This article introduces the implementation of the prototype system and builds a cloud-edge collaborative testbed consisting of Raspberry Pis and PCs. The performance evaluation results indicates that the proposed scheduling approach outperforms existing approaches.

As one of the by-products of the sharing economy, shared parking allows people to rent the idle private parking spaces nearby, balancing the parking demand in different districts. However, renters need to comprehensively measure the cost and the distance between the parking space and the destination, sometimes, in which the additional constraints (e.g. time limitation) make the decision more complicated. To solve the aforementioned challenge, a Genetic Algorithm Based Dynamic Shared Parking method is proposed. Firstly, the framework of parking space sharing for private cars in CBDs is constructed. Then, the approach based on NSGA-III is designed to generate the approximately optimal solution according to current requirements and the situation of idle parking spaces. The experiments investigate the impact of different metrics to the optimization objective in detail and the results of follow-up comparisons indicate that our method effectively saves the cost in shared parking and improves the social benefits. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Parking sharing","Multiobjective optimization; Central business districts; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimal solutions; Parking demands; Parking sharing; Parking spaces; Private cars; Private vehicles; Space-sharing; Vehicle industry; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Southwest Minzu University (2019NQN05) and 2021 College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Southwest Minzu University (202110656021).","Barone, Rosamaria Elisa, Architecture for parking management in smart cities, IET Intelligent Transport Systems, 8, 5, pp. 445-452, (2014); Cai, Yifei, A parking space allocation method to make a shared parking strategy for appertaining parking lots of public buildings, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 1, (2019); Caicedo, Felix, Real-time parking information management to reduce search time, vehicle displacement and emissions, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 15, 4, pp. 228-234, (2010); Dale, Simon, Evaluating the impact of a workplace parking levy on local traffic congestion: The case of Nottingham UK, Transport Policy, 59, pp. 153-164, (2017); Eckhardt, Giana M., Marketing in the Sharing Economy, Journal of Marketing, 83, 5, pp. 5-27, (2019); Guo, Liya, A novel agent-based transportation model of a university campus with application to quantifying the environmental cost of parking search, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 50, pp. 86-104, (2013); Guo, Wei, Parking Spaces Repurchase Strategy Design via Simulation Optimization, Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems: Technology, Planning, and Operations, 20, 3, pp. 255-269, (2016); Hou, Chenyu, A deep-learning prediction model for imbalanced time series data forecasting, Big Data Mining and Analytics, 4, 4, pp. 266-278, (2021); Jiang, Bowen, Optimal allocation of shared parking slots considering parking unpunctuality under a platform-based management approach, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 142, (2020); World Wide Web, (2021)","","Springer","","","","","","10220038; 15728196","9780123694263","WINEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126130142"

This paper constructs an optimal scheduling model for the ice-storage air-conditioning to participate in the microgrid, analyzes the regulation advantages of the ice-storage air-conditioning’s cold storage and cold release process and its participation in the scheduling process; secondly, based on the scenario method, the scenario modeling of the microgrid distributed wind and light output uncertainty and cold load uncertainty is carried out; lastly, an optimal scheduling model is constructed to minimize the operation and maintenance cost of each unit and the storage cost of the ice-storage air-conditioning, the highest rate of clean energy generation and the lowest cost of electricity consumption of the air-conditioning users as the objective function. The example simulations show that the proposed optimal scheduling model can promote the new energy consumption rate of the microgrid, proving that the ice-storage air-conditioning is more economical compared with ordinary air-conditioning and that the operating cost within the optimized microgrid is reduced by about 10.5%.

In view of the impact of poor manufacturing entity reliability and service reputation on the new-era manufacturing industry, the time-varying reliability and time-varying credibility of cloud manufacturing (CMfg) services were studied from the perspective of combining nature and society. Taking time-varying reliability, time-varying credibility, composition complexity, composition synergy, execution time, and execution cost as objective functions, a new six-dimension comprehensive evaluation model of service quality was constructed. To solve the optimization problem, this study proposes an improved chaos sparrow search algorithm (ICSSA), where the Bernoulli chaotic mapping formula was introduced to improve the basic sparrow search algorithm (BSSA), and the position calculation formulas of the explorer sparrow and the scouter sparrow were enhanced. The Bernoulli chaotic operator changed the symmetry of the BSSA, increased the uncertainty and randomness of the explorer sparrow position in the new algorithm, and affected the position update and movement strategies of the follower and scouter sparrows. The asymmetric chaotic characteristic brought better global search ability and optimization performance to the ICSSA. The comprehensive performance of the service composition (SvcComp) scheme was evaluated by calculating weighted relative deviation based on six evaluation elements. The WFG and DTLZ series test functions were selected, and the inverse generation distance (IGD) index and hyper volume (HV) index were used to compare and evaluate the convergence and diversity of the ICSSA, BSSA, PSO, SGA, and NSGA-III algorithms through simulation analysis experiments. The test results indicated that the ICSSA outperforms the BSSA, PSO, SGA, and NSGA-III in the vast majority of testing issues. Finally, taking disinfection robot manufacturing tasks as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed CMfg SvcComp optimization model and the ICSSA were verified. The case study results showed that the proposed ICSSA had faster convergence speed and better comprehensive performance for the CMfg SvcComp optimization problem compared with the BSSA, PSO, SGA, and NSGA-III. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cloud manufacturing; improved chaos sparrow search algorithm; service composition optimization; time-varying credibility; time-varying reliability","","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51375168), the Natural Science Foundation of Bijie City (Grant Nos.

The decomposition-based approach stands out among the evolutionary algorithms used for their solution, with MOEA/D and its variations playing significant roles. MOEA/D variations seek to improve weight vector definition, improve the dynamic adjustment of weight vectors during the evolution process, improve the evolutionary operators, use alternative decomposition methods, and hybridize with other metaheuristics, among others. Although an essential topic for the success of MOEA/D depends on how well the weight vectors are defined when decomposing the problem, not as much research has been performed on this topic as on the others. This paper proposes using a new mathematical object called augmented covering arrays (ACAs) that enable a better sampling of interactions of M objectives using the least number of weight vectors based on an interaction level (strength), defined a priori by the user. The proposed method obtains better results, measured in inverted generational distance, using small to medium populations (up to 850 solutions) of 30 to 100 objectives over DTLZ and WFG problems against the traditional weight vector definition used by MOEA/D-DE and results obtained by NSGA-III.

The research aimed to introduce a lightweight method for identifying Internet of Things devices based on network flow characteristics and scheduling algorithms. This can improve device identification accuracy while maintaining high efficiency. The research constructed a comprehensive optimization algorithm selection framework to achieve performance optimization in different scenarios. This framework took into account many factors, including network traffic characteristics, device identification requirements, and system efficiency, to ensure flexible adaptation in different scenarios and optimize overall performance. Research results showed that the proposed system had an accuracy of 96.8 % at 1-minute intervals, which increased to 99.7 % at 10-minute intervals, and reached 99.9 % at both 30-minute and 60-minute intervals. In 100 experiments, the research method improved the accuracy by an average of 1.5 % compared with the baseline. In fingerprint recognition, the overall accuracy of the long short-term memory network exceeded 90 %, with an area under the curve of 0.99. Most devices had an accuracy of over 95 % in recognition, and the recall rate remained around 90 %, the effectiveness of the method proposed in the study was further verified.

Despite this, existing portfolios frequently overlook the integration of stock selection outcomes and underutilize data from listed companies, leading to suboptimal portfolio performance. Addressing these shortcomings, this paper introduces a hybrid system involving stock selection and portfolio optimization. In stock selection, the system employs a combination of convolutional neural network and bi-directional recurrent neural network to predict stock trends. This approach enables the identification of stocks likely to appreciate in value, setting the stage for their inclusion in the subsequent optimization process. For portfolio optimization, the study formulates a five-objective optimization problem that incorporates mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and distance-to-default as key considerations. To solve the many-objective constrained optimization problem, an advanced strategy employing a static penalty function and an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) based on tent chaotic mapping is utilized. The efficacy of the proposed hybrid system is rigorously tested through three sets of ablation experiments alongside two discussions focused on its robustness and computational efficiency. The findings from these investigations reveal that the hybrid system outperforms traditional approaches, reducing risks and improving returns for investors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Improved optimization algorithm; Many-objective constrained optimization problem; Portfolio optimization; Stock selection","Computational efficiency; Constrained optimization; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Genetic algorithms; Higher order statistics; Investments; Recurrent neural networks; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Deep learning; Improved optimization algorithm; Many-objective constrained optimization problem; Many-objective optimizations; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Portfolio optimization; Stock portfolio; Stock selections; Hybrid systems","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China (grant number 17ZDA093).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China (grant number 17ZDA093 ).","Dezhkam, Arsalan, Forecasting stock market for an efficient portfolio by combining XGBoost and Hilbert–Huang​ transform, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 118, (2023); Chen, Yinnan, A novel MOPSO-SODE algorithm for solving three-objective SR-ES-TR portfolio optimization problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 233, (2023); J Financ, (1952); Maringer, Dietmar G., Global optimization of higher order moments in portfolio selection, Journal of Global Optimization, 43, 2-3, pp. 219-230, (2009); Liu, Liping, A new foundation for the mean-variance analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 158, 1, pp. 229-242, (2004); Samuelson, Paul A., The fundamental approximation theorem of portfolio analysis in terms of means, variances and higher moments, Review of Economic Studies, 37, 4, pp. 537-542, (1970); Zhen, Fang, A closed-form mean–variance–skewness portfolio strategy, Finance Research Letters, 47, (2022); Abid, Ilyes, PGP for portfolio optimization: application to ESG index family, Annals of Operations Research, 347, 1, pp. 405-417, (2025); Li, Xiangfa, Uncertain random portfolio optimization with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and optimal solution criterion, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 8, pp. 8511-8546, (2023); Modeling Default Risk, (2003)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190354123"

Many techniques, such as NSGA-II/NSGA-III, rely on dominance relationships among population members to prioritize evolving individuals. However, this mechanism assumes equal relationships among selected candidates, overlooking the potential of preponderant individuals to guide rapid population evolution. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm driven by preponderant individuals and symmetric sampling (MOPISS). This algorithm first establishes an individual selection strategy driven by preponderant individuals to expedite population evolution. Subsequently, it employs the count of preponderant individuals to calculate the interaction learning probability (ILP) for adaptively adjusting the genetic intensity of population. ILP is then integrated into the evolutionary process to create a novel genetic mechanism based on symmetric sampling, thereby enhancing the randomness of the solution space and genetic efficacy. Finally, MOPISS is validated across 17 benchmark functions and operational parameter optimization cases of AEP. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits a significant competitive advantage over other mainstream approaches in terms of evolutionary speed and optimization performance. Specifically, it can increase current efficiency by approximately 3% and reduce energy consumption by 276 kW⋅h/t-Al for AEP. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aluminum electrolysis; Genetic mechanism; Multi-objective optimization; Operational parameters; Preponderant individuals","Aluminum; Competition; Electrolysis; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Aluminum electrolysis; Electrolysis process; Genetic mechanism; Learning probability; Multi-objectives optimization; Operational parameters; Optimization algorithms; Population evolution; Preponderant individual; Symmetrics; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported in part by Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing under grant CSTB2023NSCQ-MSX0537 and CSTB2023NSCQ-MSX0421 , National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 62373069 , Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission under Grant KJQN202200531 , Foundation Program of Chongqing Normal University under Grant 22XLB014 .","Tian, Shuoshuo, Comprehensive assessment of energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction in future aluminum supply chain, Applied Energy, 305, (2022); Shen, Angxing, Technologies for CO2 emission reduction and low-carbon development in primary aluminum industry in China: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 189, (2024); Ding, Wei, Dynamic evolutionary model based on a multi-sampling inherited HAPFNN for an aluminium electrolysis manufacturing system, Applied Soft Computing, 99, (2021); Yao, Lizhong, An improved feed-forward neural network based on UKF and strong tracking filtering to establish energy consumption model for aluminum electrolysis process, Neural Computing and Applications, 31, 8, pp. 4271-4285, (2019); Li, Xiaoqing, Constructing a stable interface film on both cathode and anode via a novel electrolyte additive for high performance LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite pouch cell, Journal of Power Sources, 596, (2024); Light Metals, (2011); Yao, Lizhong, A multiobjective prediction model with incremental learning ability by developing a multi-source filter neural network for the electrolytic aluminium process, Applied Intelligence, 52, 15, pp. 17387-17409, (2022); Jie, Wang, Optimization of aluminum fluoride addition in aluminum electrolysis process based on pruned sparse fuzzy neural network, ISA Transactions, 133, pp. 285-301, (2023); Kolås, Steinar, Bath temperature and AlF3 control of an aluminium electrolysis cell, Control Engineering Practice, 17, 9, pp. 1035-1043, (2009); Yi, Jun, Optimized relative transformation matrix using bacterial foraging algorithm for process fault detection, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 63, 4, pp. 2595-2605, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190108612"

However, conventional centralized ML and data analytics systems are fraught with vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to data breaches, loss of system control, and other malicious attacks. Enter Federated Learning (FL), a promising paradigm within ML that prioritizes data confidentiality and decentralized model training. Nevertheless, to harness its full potential and ensure optimal performance, an optimization process is required. This optimization challenge is further compounded by the fact that it falls into the category of NP-hard scheduling problems. Moreover, recent novel attacks on FL architecture have raised substantial security concerns. In this paper, we present a novel approach that marries Blockchain technology with the third-generation Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) to fortify the defense against attacks targeting FL algorithms operating within Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Our holistic optimization approach, underpinned by Blockchain, guarantees not only the veracity of trained models but also optimizes processing time and reduces the success rate of potential attacks. Consequently, we propose a hybrid methodology that integrates Blockchain and FL optimization, safeguarding ML models from a spectrum of threats while preserving user privacy. To tackle the bi-objective FL optimization problem, we introduce an efficient NSGA-III algorithm.

Moreover, Mg alloys are regarded as one of the promising candidates for manufacturing ureteral stents. This study proposed a multi-objective optimization method based on the Kriging surrogate model, NSGA-Ⅲ, and finite element analysis to improve the degradation performance of Mg alloy ureteral stents. Methods: The finite element model for the degradation of Mg alloy ureteral stents has been established to compare the degradation performance of the stents under different parameters. Latin hypercube sampling was adopted to generate train sample points in the design space. Meanwhile, the Kriging surrogate model was constructed between strut parameters and stent degradation behavior. The NSGA-Ⅲ was utilized to determine the optimal solution in the global design space. Results: The optimized stent achieved 5.52 ​× ​degradation uniformity (M), 10 ​× ​degradation time (DT), and 4 ​× ​work time (FT). The errors between the Kriging surrogate model and the finite element calculation results were less than 6%. Conclusion: The optimized stent achieved better degradation performance.

However, due to the limited processing power and storage of edge nodes, lightweight models with high detection accuracy are urgently needed. The Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique based on multi-objective genetic algorithms can simultaneously balance model complexity and performance, thus automatically designing models for fast and accurate detection. However, NAS requires training each model from scratch during the optimization process to obtain its detection accuracy as one of the fitness evaluation criteria. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient predictor-assisted NSGA-III algorithm. It uses proxy models to swiftly predict architecture accuracy, eliminating the need for complete training and greatly improving optimization efficiency. Furthermore, we have designed an innovative search space that allows for the reduction of internal channels and output feature map dimensions within the model, resulting in the creation of lightweight models with minimal impact on classification performance. The proposed method is validated by searching a narrower Pareto-optimal model of the competitive F1 score of 95.17% with 38.10 MB FLOPs on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. By adding a predictor, the number of optimizations per iteration increased, leading to faster convergence. Additionally, when comparing the search spaces before and after our design in the most complex structure (with 7 cells), the model's classification error rate increased from 4.31% to 4.36%, while the FLOPs decreased from 271.13MB to 186.9MB. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Channel pruning; deep learning; Internet of Things security; model compression; network architecture search","Complex networks; Computer architecture; Data privacy; Deep learning; Digital storage; Edge computing; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Pareto principle; Channel pruning; Computational modelling; Detection accuracy; Edge nodes; Features extraction; Internet of thing security; Model compression; Network architecture search; Neural architectures; Network architecture","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62227805 and Grant 62071056.","2020 Unit 42 Iot Threat Report; Mobilenets Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications, (2017); Efficientdet Scalable and Efficient Object Detection, (2019); International Conference on Learning Representations, (2017); Binarizing Mobilenet Via Evolution Based Searching; Zoph, Barret, Neural architecture search with reinforcement learning, (2017); Zoph, Barret, Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8697-8710, (2018); Huang, Gao, Densely connected convolutional networks, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 2261-2269, (2017); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); Jain, Himanshu, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point based nondominated sorting approach, Part II: Handling constraints and extending to an adaptive approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 602-622, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23327731","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182935852"

In traditional inverse analysis methods, the deformation moduli are identified based on the single-objective optimization and the hydrostatic component derived from the statistical model. This type of method has two main shortcomings: First, it treats the essential multi-objective optimization problem as a single-objective problem; second, the extracted hydrostatic component may be biased due to the multicollinearity of variables in the statistical model. This paper presents a methodology for the inverse analysis of the deformation moduli of high arch dams under a multi-objective optimization strategy. The methodology employs empirical mode decomposition to extract the aging component from displacement monitoring data. Then, thermomechanical analysis is used to reconstruct the remaining hydrostatic and temperature components, thereby avoiding the biases encountered in solving the statistical model. The adaptive polynomial chaos expansion method is embedded in the NSGA-III algorithm to establish and solve multi-objective functions in the inverse analysis. Additionally, a composite decision index considering errors and test information is proposed to determine acceptable deformation moduli from the Pareto solution set. A high arch dam is selected to illustrate this methodology with static and dynamic monitoring data. The results show that the identified deformation moduli have errors of 3.8% and 7.2% in displacement and acceleration, respectively. The proposed methodology can yield deformation modulus values that are more consistent with the physical implications than those of the single-objective optimization method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Acceleration; Arch dams; Arches; Empirical mode decomposition; Hydraulics; Inverse problems; Regression analysis; Deformation modulus; Displacement monitoring; Displacement reconstruction; High arch dams; Hydrostatic components; Inverse analysis; Multi-objectives optimization; Reconstruction techniques; Single objective optimization; Statistic modeling; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; dam; deformation; displacement; empirical analysis; inverse problem; optimization","","","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 52309162), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Number YJ202287), and the Key Research Program of Sichuan Province (Grant Number 2022YFS0535).

Typically, there is not a single ideal design; rather, there are several Pareto-optimal designs that provide the best possible trade-offs between the objectives. However, evaluating every design might be expensive, making a thorough search for the whole Pareto optimum set impractical. The aforementioned issue with technology computer-aided design (TCAD) while investigating a multidimensional parameter set for device design is addressed using Pareto active learning (PAL) and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) which are metaheuristics-based multiobjective optimization (MOO) techniques. NSGA-III adeptly analyzes the tradeoffs among multiple objectives while ensuring diversity in the design space. PAL forecasts the Pareto-optimal set with intelligence by deliberately sampling the design space. This work focusses on improving the performance of surrounding gate tunnel field-effect transistors (SGTFETs) by optimizing and assessing their complex designs in terms of multiple objectives, including power, energy, speed, and variability. This paper presents a novel MOO framework that incorporates machine learning (ML) approaches, including NSGA-III and PAL in SGTFETs technology. The framework provides effective global optimization without gradients, allowing for the automatic recognition of the best solutions. The outcomes show the possibility of ML-based MOO to create next-generation nanoscale transistors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","machine learning; multiobjective optimization; nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Pareto active learning algorithm; power; speed; surrounding gate tunnel field-effect transistors; technology computer-aided design; variability","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Electronic design automation; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Pareto principle; Tunnel field effect transistors; Active-learning algorithm; Machine-learning; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Pareto active learning algorithm; Power; Surrounding gate tunnel field-effect transistor; Surrounding-gate; Technology computer aided design; Variability; Multiobjective optimization","","","This project is gratefully acknowledged to have received funding from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) through the \u201CTeachers Associate for Research Excellence (TARE)\u201D scheme, with reference number (TAR/2020/000231).","Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Evolutionary Algorithms and Neural Networks, (2019); Shami, Tareq M., Particle Swarm Optimization: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 10031-10061, (2022); Rokbani, Nizar, Bi-heuristic ant colony optimization-based approaches for traveling salesman problem, Soft Computing, 25, 5, pp. 3775-3794, (2021); Ait-Saadi, Amylia, A novel hybrid Chaotic Aquila Optimization algorithm with Simulated Annealing for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles path planning, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 104, (2022); Lee, Min-jin, Analytical model of single-gate silicon-on-insulator (SOI) tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs), Solid-State Electronics, 63, 1, pp. 110-114, (2011); Bhuwalka, Krishna Kumar, Scaling the vertical tunnel FET with tunnel bandgap modulation and gate workfunction engineering, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, 52, 5, pp. 909-917, (2005); Arun Samuel, T.

In multi-objective optimization (MOO), multiple conflicting functions are optimized within defined criteria. Numerous MOO techniques have been developed utilizing various meta-heuristic methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), Genetic Algorithms (GAs), and other biologically inspired processes. In a cooperative environment, a Pareto front is generated, and an MOO technique is applied to solve for the solution set. On other hand, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is often used to select a single best solution from a set of provided solution candidates. The Multi-Criteria Decision Making–Pareto Front (M-PF) optimizer combines both of these techniques to find a quality set of heuristic solutions. This paper provides an improved version of the M-PF optimizer, which is called the elite Multi-Criteria Decision Making–Pareto Front (eMPF) optimizer. The eMPF method uses an evolutionary algorithm for the meta-heuristic process and then generates a Pareto front and applies MCDM to the Pareto front to rank the solutions in the set. The main objective of the new optimizer is to exploit the Pareto front while also exploring the solution area. The performance of the developed method is tested against M-PF, Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III). The test results demonstrate the performance of the new eMPF optimizer over M-PF, NSGA-II, and NSGA-III. eMPF was not only able to exploit the search domain but also was able to find better heuristic solutions for most of the test functions used. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary Algorithms; heuristics; Multi-Criteria Decision Making; multi-objective optimization; Pareto front","Biomimetics; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Heuristic; Heuristic solutions; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization techniques; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Optimizers; Pareto front; Performance; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Computers and Intractability A Guide to the Theory of Np Completeness, (1979); Hooshyar, Maral, Meta-heuristic Algorithms in UAV Path Planning Optimization: A Systematic Review (2018–2022), Drones, 7, 12, (2023); Muñoz, Mario Andrés, Algorithm selection for black-box continuous optimization problems: A survey on methods and challenges, Information Sciences, 317, pp. 224-245, (2015); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Kennedy, James, Particle swarm optimization, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks - Conference Proceedings, 4, pp. 1942-1948, (1995); Dorigo, Marco, Ant colony optimization artificial ants as a computational intelligence technique, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 1, 4, pp. 28-39, (2006); Horn, Jeffrey A., Niched Pareto genetic algorithm for multiobjective optimization, 1, pp. 82-87, (1994); Gunasekara, Chulaka, Multi-objective optimization to identify key players in social networks, pp. 443-450, (2014); Stavroulakis, Georgios Ε., Review of Computational Mechanics, Optimization, and Machine Learning Tools for Digital Twins Applied to Infrastructures, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 23, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19994893","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194280885"

This paper expands the current understanding of design frameworks that balance cost, environmental impacts, social factors, and structural integrity. Integrating MOO with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), the study targets enhancements in life cycle sustainability for complex engineering projects using precast modular road frames. Three advanced evolutionary algorithms—NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and RVEA—are optimized and deployed to address sustainability objectives under performance constraints. The efficacy of these algorithms is gauged through a comparative analysis, and a robust MCDM approach is applied to nine non-dominated solutions, employing SAW, FUCA, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, and VIKOR decision-making techniques. An entropy theory-based method ensures systematic, unbiased criteria weighting, augmenting the framework’s capacity to pinpoint designs balancing life cycle sustainability. The results reveal that NSGA-III is the algorithm converging towards the most cost-effective solutions, surpassing NSGA-II and RVEA by 21.11% and 10.07%, respectively, while maintaining balanced environmental and social impacts. The RVEA achieves up to 15.94% greater environmental efficiency than its counterparts. The analysis of non-dominated solutions identifies the (Formula presented.) design, utilizing 35 MPa concrete and B500S steel, as the most sustainable alternative across 80% of decision-making algorithms. The ranking correlation coefficients above 0.94 demonstrate consistency among decision-making techniques, underscoring the robustness of the integrated MOO and MCDM framework. The results in this paper expand the understanding of the applicability of novel techniques for enhancing engineering practices and advocate for a comprehensive strategy that employs advanced MOO algorithms and MCDM to enhance sustainable infrastructure development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FUCA; multi-criteria decision-making; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-II; NSGA-III; PROMETHEE; RVEA; SAW; TOPSIS; VIKOR","","","","Grant PID2020-117056RB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by \u201CERDF A way of making Europe\u201D.","Kyriacou, Andreas P., The efficiency of transport infrastructure investment and the role of government quality: An empirical analysis, Transport Policy, 74, pp. 93-102, (2019); Our Common Future, (1987); A Sustainable Future for the European Cement and Concrete Industry Technology Assessment for Full Decarbonisation of the Industry by 2050, (2018); Santoro, Jair Frederico, Evaluation of CO2 emissions in RC structures considering local and global databases, Innovative Infrastructure Solutions, 9, 2, (2024); Yepes, Víctor, Economic heuristic optimization for heterogeneous gleet VRPHESTW, Journal of Transportation Engineering, 132, 4, pp. 303-311, (2006); Spangenberg, Joachim H., Design for Sustainability (DfS): The interface of sustainable production and consumption, Journal of Cleaner Production, 18, 15, pp. 1485-1493, (2010); Zhang, Zhenyu, Pareto multi-objective optimization of metro train energy-saving operation using improved NSGA-II algorithms, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 176, (2023); Lahmar, Salma, Multiobjective building design optimization using an efficient adaptive Kriging metamodel, Simulation, 101, 5, pp. 557-573, (2025); Rastegaran, Mostafa, Multi-objective reliability-based seismic performance design optimization of SMRFs considering various sources of uncertainty, Engineering Structures, 261, (2022); Ruiz-Vélez, Andrés, Sustainable Road Infrastructure Decision-Making: Custom NSGA-II with Repair Operators for Multi-Objective Optimization, Mathematics, 12, 5, (2024)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194091329"

In this work, we formulate a UAVs-aided D2D network resource scheduling optimization problem (NetResSOP) to comprehensively consider the number of deployed UAVs, UAV positions, UAV transmission powers, UAV flight velocities, communication channels, and UAV-device pair assignment so as to maximize the D2D network capacity, minimize the number of deployed UAVs, and minimize the average energy consumption over all UAVs simultaneously. The formulated NetResSOP is a mixed-integer programming problem (MIPP) and an NP-hard problem, which means that it is difficult to be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, there are trade-offs between the optimization objectives, and hence it is also difficult to find an optimal solution that can simultaneously make all objectives be optimal. Thus, we propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III with a Flexible solution dimension mechanism, a Discrete part generation mechanism, and a UAV number adjustment mechanism (NSGA-III-FDU) for solving the problem comprehensively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the stability of the proposed NSGA-III-FDU under different scales and settings of the D2D networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","channel allocation; device-to-device network capacity; flight energy consumption; UAV; UAV-device pair assignment","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Computational complexity; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Polynomial approximation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aerial vehicle; Channel allocation; Device-to-Device communications; Device-to-device network capacity; Energy-consumption; Flight energy consumption; Network Capacity; Optimisations; Relay; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicle-device pair assignment; Energy utilization","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62172186, Grant 62002133, Grant 61872158, and Grant 62272194; in part by the Science and Technology Development Plan Project of Jilin Province under Grant 20230201087GX; and in part by the China Scholarship Council.","Jia, Ziye, Hierarchical Aerial Computing for Internet of Things via Cooperation of HAPs and UAVs, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 10, 7, pp. 5676-5688, (2023); Gao, Hui, Machine Learning-Empowered Beam Management for mmWave-NOMA in Multi-UAVs Networks, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 71, 8, pp. 8487-8502, (2022); Liu, Yanheng, Joint Scheduling and Trajectory Optimization of Charging UAV in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 9, 14, pp. 11796-11813, (2022); Xu, Yongjun, Robust Resource Allocation Algorithm for Energy-Harvesting-Based D2D Communication Underlaying UAV-Assisted Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 23, pp. 17161-17171, (2021); Zhong, Xijian, Joint Optimization of Relay Deployment, Channel Allocation, and Relay Assignment for UAVs-Aided D2D Networks, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 28, 2, pp. 804-817, (2020); Javidsharifi, Mahshid, PV-Powered Base Stations Equipped by UAVs in Urban Areas, IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, 2022-September, (2022); Han, Chao, Joint UAV Deployment and Power Allocation for Secure Space-Air-Ground Communications, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 70, 10, pp. 6804-6818, (2022); Kaleem, Zeeshan, Learning-Aided UAV 3D Placement and Power Allocation for Sum-Capacity Enhancement Under Varying Altitudes, IEEE Communications Letters, 26, 7, pp. 1633-1637, (2022); Sun, Geng, Secure and Energy-Efficient UAV Relay Communications Exploiting Collaborative Beamforming, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 70, 8, pp. 5401-5416, (2022); Chen, Hanxiao, PriVDT: An Efficient Two-Party Cryptographic Framework for Vertical Decision Trees, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 18, pp. 1006-1021, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15361276; 15582248","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174825273"

This incites increased packet delay and packet losses. Existing congestion control strategies are either inelastic or have limited elasticity. Numerous elastic approaches, such as Cuckoo Fuzzy PID (CFPID), PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)-neural PID, and PSO Fuzzy PID have been introduced using meta-heuristics and evolutionary algorithms; nevertheless, these are slow and prematurely converge, indicating an NP-hard problem. Moreover, Multi-objective Proportional Integral Derivative (MPID) is articulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is followed by many researchers but suffers from overshoot defects. To address these issues, the hybrid controller is proposed using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III and MPID called N3-MPID to optimize the data transmission rate for the source node. The four indirect objectives that are Integral Square Error, Integral Absolute Error, Integral of Time multiplied Absolute Error, and Integral of Time multiplied Square Error are taken to design a novel optimal MPID fitness function. To merge these objectives into a single goal, an equally weighted procedure is adopted that is efficient and well-distributed. The proposed technique is simulated using a Network Simulator and is compared with CFPID using principal metrics. Simulation results depict that the N3-MPID outflanks existing algorithms by an 11.76% increase in packet delivery ratio while minimizing packet loss, average delay, and deviation of queue length by 43.16%, 20.55%, and 15.05%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective; NSGA-III; Rate adaptation","Computational complexity; Errors; Fuzzy logic; Multiobjective optimization; Packet loss; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Proportional control systems; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Wireless sensor networks; Event-driven; Fuzzy-PID; Multi objective; Network traffic; NSGA-III; Particle swarm; PID controllers; Proportional integral derivatives; Rate-adaptation; Swarm optimization; Genetic algorithms","","","","Yadav, Saneh Lata, Traffic and Energy Aware Optimization for Congestion Control in Next Generation Wireless Sensor Networks, Journal of Sensors, 2021, (2021); Rashedi, Esmat, GSA: A Gravitational Search Algorithm, Information Sciences, 179, 13, pp. 2232-2248, (2009); Shah, Syed Afsar, Congestion control algorithms in wireless sensor networks: Trends and opportunities, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 29, 3, pp. 236-245, (2017); Fei, Zesong, A Survey of Multi-Objective Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks: Metrics, Algorithms, and Open Problems, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 19, 1, pp. 550-586, (2017); Bohloulzadeh, Atousa, A Survey on Congestion Control Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks, International Journal of Wireless Information Networks, 27, 3, pp. 365-384, (2020); Bhatti, Kabeer Ahmed, Multi-objective fuzzy krill herd congestion control algorithm for WSN, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 83, 1, pp. 2093-2121, (2024); Rezaee, Abbas Ali, Optimized congestion management protocol for healthcare wireless sensor networks, Wireless Personal Communications, 75, 1, pp. 11-34, (2014); Qureshi, Imran Ali, FuCWO: a novel fuzzy-based approach of contention window optimization for IEEE-802.15.6 WBANs, Applied Intelligence, 53, 10, pp. 12132-12148, (2023); Sumathi, K., Dynamic alternate buffer switching and congestion control in wireless multimedia sensor networks, Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications, 13, 6, pp. 2001-2010, (2020); Lin, Lin, A novel fuzzy PID congestion control model based on cuckoo search in WSNs, Sensors, 20, 7, (2020)","","Springer","","","","","","10220038; 15728196","9780123694263","WINEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178410905"

However, because of the extra logic needed for the caching mechanism, one of these networks’ main challenges is optimizing the trade-off between transmission and caching energy consumption. Moreover, in an energy-aware CCN, less popular content is cached near the content provider despite more popular content caching near end users. Therefore, in real-time or delay-sensitive traffic with less popularity, this caching strategy degrades the quality of service, drops delayed chunks, and wastes energy consumption. Accordingly, designing an appropriate content caching policy to improve energy efficiency and service quality is a long-term goal of the green CCN. This paper considers minimizing energy consumption and the queuing delay in CCN as a multi-objective optimization problem. Thus, to drive the proposed approach, called ED-CCN-MOP, the CCN queuing delay for receiving the Interest and Data packets is analyzed and formulated. Furthermore, the ED-CCN-MOP model is solved using the proposed Non-dominated Sorting Markov Approximation (NSMA) method. According to the numerical results, the NSMA algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MODA algorithms by about 49%, 46%, and 38%, respectively, in terms of their average energy-delay-product metric with the possibility of distributed implementation. Furthermore, the quality of NSMA solutions is evaluated and compared using performance metrics. The results of this evaluation indicate that NSMA consistently achieves a high level of performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analysis of CCN queuing delay; CCN resource allocation; Energy-aware caching strategy in green CCN; Markov approximation approach; Multiobjective optimization","Delay-sensitive applications; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Multiobjective optimization; Power management (telecommunication); Quality control; Quality of service; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Analyse of content-centric network queuing delay; Approximation approach; Caching strategy; Content-centric network resource allocation; Content-centric networks; Energy aware; Energy-aware caching strategy in green content-centric network; Markov approximation; Markov approximation approach; Multi-objectives optimization; Network queuing delays; Network resource allocations; Energy utilization","","","","Jacobson, Van L., Networking named content, pp. 1-12, (2009); Furqan, Muhammad, An Energy-Efficient Collaborative Caching Scheme for 5G Wireless Network, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 156907-156916, (2019); Lee, Uichin, Toward energy-efficient content dissemination, IEEE Network, 25, 2, pp. 14-19, (2011); Qazi, Faiza, Optimal Content Caching in Content-Centric Networks, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2019, (2019); Siddiqa, Ayesha, CCN: A novel energy efficient greedy routing protocol for green computing, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 31, 23, (2019); Shan, Siyang, Proactive caching placement for arbitrary topology with multi-hop forwarding in ICN, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 149117-149131, (2019); In Advances in Computing Informatics Networking and Cybersecurity, (2022); Chen, Minghua, Markov approximation for combinatorial network optimization, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 59, 10, pp. 6301-6327, (2013); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Choi, Nakjung, In-network caching effect on optimal energy consumption in content-centric networking, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, pp. 2889-2894, (2012)","","Springer","","","","","","10220038; 15728196","9780123694263","WINEF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177694238"

However, selecting microscopic parameters is complicated due to the diversity and complexity of landslide material composition, induced mechanism and geological conditions. This study proposed an intelligent calibration method of microscopic parameters based on the measured landslide accumulation morphology. Post-sliding accumulation thickness, sliding height difference, sliding distance and accumulation dip were proposed to describe the morphological characteristics of landslide accumulation. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was used to establish the training sample set. The surrogate model of the discrete element numerical simulation method was established by combining the relevance vector mechanism (RVM) and the third-generation nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to find the nonlinear relationship between the accumulation characteristics after landslide and microscopic parameters. Based on the calibration results, the area that may be affected by landslides was predicted. The results showed that the similarity between the calculated value of the intelligent model and the measured value was 97.49%.

In this paper, we proposed a practical stochastic reliability method based on the third-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA–III) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The proposed method used the Latin hypercube sampling method to generate the dataset samples of geo-mechanical parameters and adopted XGBoost to establish the model of the nonlinear relationship between displacements and surrounding rock mechanical parameters. And NSGA–III was used to optimize the surrogate model hyper-parameters. Finally, the failure probability was computed by the optimized surrogate model. The proposed approach was firstly implemented in the analysis of a horseshoe-shaped highway tunnel to illustrate the efficiency of the approach. Then, in comparison to the support vector regression method and the back propagation neural network method, the feasibility, validity and advantages of XGBoost were demonstrated for practical problems. Using XGBoost to achieve Monte Carlo simulation, a surrogate solution can be provided for numerical simulation analysis to overcome the time-consuming reliability evaluation of initial support structures in soft rock tunnels.

Recognizing it as an NP-hard problem, this article proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based optimization algorithm. Within a custom multi-agent simulation environment, representing power-generating units as collaborative types of reinforcement learning (RL) agents, the MOPS problem is decomposed into sequential Markov decision processes (MDPs). The MDPs are then utilized for training an MADRL model, which subsequently offers the optimal solution to the optimization problem. The practical viability of the proposed method is evaluated across several experimental test systems consisting of up to 100 units featuring bi-objective and tri-objective problems. The results demonstrate that the proposed MADRL algorithm has better performance compared to established methods, such as teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), real coded grey wolf optimization (RCGWO), evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (EAD), non-dominated sorting algorithm II (NSGA-II), and non-dominated sorting algorithm III (NSGA-III). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep reinforcement learning; economic dispatch; environmental dispatch; multi-objective optimization; unit commitment","","","","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Education (2021R1I1A3047456).","Electrical Power Unit Commitment Deterministic and Two Stage Stochastic Programming Models and Algorithms, (2017); Goyal, Sunil Kumar, Economic Load Dispatch with Emission and Line Constraints using Biogeography Based Optimization Technique, pp. 471-476, (2020); Middle East J Sci Res, (2017); Montero, Luis, A Review on the Unit Commitment Problem: Approaches, Techniques, and Resolution Methods, Energies, 15, 4, (2022); Qin, Jingtao, Solving Unit Commitment Problems with Multi-step Deep Reinforcement Learning, pp. 140-145, (2021); De Oliveira, Layon M., Search Space Reduction for the Thermal Unit Commitment Problem through a Relevance Matrix, Energies, 15, 19, (2022); Bendotti, Pascale, On the complexity of the Unit Commitment Problem, Annals of Operations Research, 274, 1-2, pp. 119-130, (2019); Roy, Priyanka, Modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm with genetic algorithm crossover for solving economic load dispatch problem with valve-point effect, Applied Soft Computing, 13, 11, pp. 4244-4252, (2013); Wang, Tiancai, Collective neurodynamic optimization for economic emission dispatch problem considering valve point effect in microgrid, Neural Networks, 93, pp. 126-136, (2017); Wang, C.

In addition, PASP is used in dynamic scenarios where patients are expected to arrive at the hospital sequentially, which requires dynamic optimization handling. Taking both aspects, optimization and dynamic utilization, we propose a simulation for dynamic patient scheduling based on multi-objective optimization, window, and coordinator. The role of multi-objective optimization deals with many soft constraints and providing a set of non-dominated solution coordinators. The role of the counter is to collect newly arrived patients and previously unconfirmed patients with the aim of passing them on to the coordinator. Finally, the role of the coordinator is to select a subset of patients from the window and pass them to the optimization algorithm. On the other hand, the coordinator is also responsible for those selected from the non-dominant solutions to activate it in the hospital and decide on unconfirmed employees to place them in the window for the next round. Simulator evaluation and comparison between several optimization algorithms show the superiority of NSGA-III in terms of set criticality and soft constraint values. Therefore, it treats PASP as a multi-objective dynamic optimization of a useful solution.

In terms of disassembly efficiency, the number of disassembly skills possessed by workers plays a crucial role in improving disassembly efficiency. Therefore, in order to effectively and reasonably disassemble discarded products, this paper proposes a partial parallel disassembly line balancing problem (PP-DLBP) that takes into account the number of worker skills. In this paper, the disassembly tasks and the disassembly relationships between components are described using AND–OR graphs. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model is established aiming to maximize the net profit of disassembly and minimize the number of skills for the workers. Based on the bat algorithm (BA), we propose an improved discrete bat algorithm (IDBA), which involves designing adaptive composite optimization operators to replace the original continuous formula expressions and applying them to solve the PP-DLBP. To demonstrate the advantages of IDBA, we compares it with NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA-II, ESPEA, and MOEA/D. Experimental results show that IDBA outperforms the other five algorithms in real disassembly cases and exhibits high efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","disassembly skills; discrete bat algorithm; multi-objective optimization; parallel disassembly lines","","","","This work is supported in part by NSFC under Grant Nos. 61573089 and 51405075; Liaoning Province Education Department Scientific Research Foundation of China under Grant No. JYTQN2023366; LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program under Grant No. XLYC1907166; The Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under Grant ZR2019BF004.","Qi, Liang, A State-Equation-Based Backward Approach to a Legal Firing Sequence Existence Problem in Petri Nets, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 53, 8, pp. 4968-4979, (2023); Cui, Xinshuo, Discrete Whale Optimization Algorithm for Disassembly Line Balancing With Carbon Emission Constraint, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 8, 5, pp. 3055-3061, (2023); Qin, Shujin, Multiobjective Multiverse Optimizer for Multirobotic U-Shaped Disassembly Line Balancing Problems, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, 5, 2, pp. 882-894, (2024); Liang, Junyong, Minimizing energy consumption in multi-objective two-sided disassembly line balancing problem with complex execution constraints using dual-individual simulated annealing algorithm, Journal of Cleaner Production, 284, (2021); Qin, Shujin, A Salp Swarm Algorithm for Parallel Disassembly Line Balancing Considering Workers With Government Benefits, IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems, 11, 1, pp. 282-291, (2024); Pistolesi, Francesco, TeMA: A Tensorial Memetic Algorithm for Many-Objective Parallel Disassembly Sequence Planning in Product Refurbishment, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 15, 6, pp. 3743-3753, (2019); Liang, Wei, Modeling and Optimization of Parallel Disassembly Line Balancing Problem with Parallel Workstations, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 19, 11, pp. 10684-10692, (2023); Guo, Xiwang, Multiresource-Constrained Selective Disassembly with Maximal Profit and Minimal Energy Consumption, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 18, 2, pp. 804-816, (2021); Bentaha, Mohand Lounes, Profit-oriented partial disassembly line design: dealing with hazardous parts and task processing times uncertainty, International Journal of Production Research, 56, 24, pp. 7220-7242, (2018); Çil, Zeynel Abidin Abidin, Robotic disassembly line balancing problem: A mathematical model and ant colony optimization approach, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 86, pp. 335-348, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187474603"

The aim of this research is to propose an optimal design for an intelligent supply chain of multiple perishable products under a vendor-managed inventory management policy aided by IoT-related technologies to address the challenges associated with traditional supply chains. Various levels of the intelligent supply chain employ technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Blockchain. In this paper, we develop a bi-objective nonlinear integer mathematical programming model for designing a four-level supply chain consisting of suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and customers. The model determines the optimal network nodes, production level, product distribution and sales, and optimal choice of technology for each level. The objective functions are total cost and delivery times. The GAMS 24.2.1 optimization software is employed to solve the mathematical model in small dimensions. Considering the NP-Hard nature of the problem, the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is employed, and its performance is compared with the Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) and NSGA-III.

This model offers insights for proactive preparation before disruptive events and facilitates optimal decision-making in the aftermath of such disruptions. Our approach involves a non-linear programming model that operates at both strategic and operational decision levels. It aims to simultaneously minimize total maintenance costs while maximizing resilience by determining the allocation of backup resources to system components before a disruption occurs and suggesting emergency maintenance team assignments post-disruption, all while adhering to resilience constraints. We quantify resilience using a dynamic Bayesian Network method and Markov process, utilizing metrics based on absorption, adaptation, and restoration performance (reliability) curves.

Both continuous and binary versions of this algorithm have already been proposed. Generally, optimization problems can be divided into single-objective and multi-objective problems. Although BRO has successfully solved single-objective optimization problems, no multi-objective version has been proposed for it yet. This gap motivated us to design and implement the multi-objective version of BRO (MOBRO). Although there are some multi-objective optimization algorithms in the literature, according to the no-free-lunch theorem, no optimization algorithm can efficiently solve all optimization problems. We applied the proposed algorithm to four benchmark datasets: CEC 2009, CEC 2018, ZDT, and DTLZ. We measured the performance of MOBRO based on three aspects: convergence, spread, and distribution, using three performance criteria: inverted generational distance, maximum spread, and spacing. We also compared its obtained results with those of three state-of-the-art optimization algorithms: the multi-objective Gray Wolf optimization algorithm (MOGWO), the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO), the multi-objective artificial vulture’s optimization algorithm (MOAVAO), the optimization algorithm for multi-objective problems (MAOA), and the multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). The obtained results approve that MOBRO outperforms the existing optimization algorithms in most of the benchmark suites and operates competitively with them in the others. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battle royale optimization algorithm; Battle-royale-game-based optimization algorithms; Multi-objective problems; Optimization","Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Screening; Battle royale optimization algorithm; Battle-royale-game-based optimization algorithm; Game-Based; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Optimizers; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Wolpert, David H., No free lunch theorems for optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 1, 1, pp. 67-82, (1997); Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems an Introductory Analysis with Applications to Biology Control and Artificial Intelligence, (1992); Askarzadeh, Alireza, Bird mating optimizer: An optimization algorithm inspired by bird mating strategies, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 19, 4, pp. 1213-1228, (2014); Swarm Intelligence, (2007); Karaboga, Dervis, A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, Journal of Global Optimization, 39, 3, pp. 459-471, (2007); Savsani, Poonam V., Passing vehicle search (PVS): A novel metaheuristic algorithm, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 40, 5-6, pp. 3951-3978, (2016); Rashedi, Esmat, GSA: A Gravitational Search Algorithm, Information Sciences, 179, 13, pp. 2232-2248, (2009); Rahkar Farshi, Taymaz, Battle royale optimization algorithm, Neural Computing and Applications, 33, 4, pp. 1139-1157, (2021); Akan, Taymaz, BinBRO: Binary Battle Royale Optimizer algorithm[Formula presented], Expert Systems with Applications, 195, (2022); Zhou, Aimin Min, Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: A survey of the state of the art, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 1, 1, pp. 32-49, (2011)","","Springer","","","","","","15730484; 09208542","","JOSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174225797"

The proposed algorithm is based on the gradient-based predictor–corrector directed search method and it allows the efficient fine-tuning of a neural network (NN) without retraining the entire model. The contributions include the computation of the Jacobian using batches of data to account for GPU memory limitations, special routines for better approximating boundaries, and an early stopping criterion that limits the search space. Additionally, the proposed method scales well with the problem dimension given that it employs the Jacobian to steer the search in the objective space. The effectiveness of the algorithm is exemplified by fine-tuning a forecasting NN model, responsible for producing multi-horizon quantile forecasts of the S&P 500 Futures financial time series. The stochastic directed search optimizes the neural network in only 1.5% of the training time, i.e. 29.56 s, and the Pareto front obtained shows that variations of around 30% can be obtained for the objective with a degradation of only 5% in the loss function. When solving large problem instances with dimensions up to 240,000, the results show that it outperforms NSGA-II and NSGA-III by reducing function evaluations by a factor of 100, while increasing by more than 5% the hypervolume of Pareto fronts. Notably, this work showcases how a large NN model can be fine-tuned using a multi-objective framework. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuation method; Directed search; Multi-objective optimization; Neural networks; Pareto optimization","Deep neural networks; Financial data processing; Neural network models; Pareto principle; Stochastic systems; Continuation method; Directed searches; Fine tuning; Jacobians; Multi-objectives optimization; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Pareto front; Pareto-optimization; Stochastics; Multiobjective optimization","","","Samuel López-Ruiz gratefully acknowledges the scholarship from CONACyT to pursue his postgraduate studies.

In DQNSGA, an initialization method based on heuristic rules and an insertional greedy decoding approach are designed, and a double-Q Learning with an improved ε-greedy strategy is used to adaptively adjust the key parameters of NSGA-III. An improved elite selection strategy is also applied. Through extensive experiments and practical case studies, this algorithm has been compared with three other well-known algorithms.

However, thus far, all exiting researches about DFJSP have not consider order cancellation, which normally leads to resource waste and makes the original scheme infeasible. Hence, in this work, we propose a DFJSP considering order cancellation (DFJSPC) for the first time; and design a reformative memetic algorithm (RMA) to solve the DFJSPC aiming at optimizing the makespan and total energy consumption. In the RMA, a five-layer encoding operator and a new load balancing initialization method are designed to improve the quality of the initial population. Some effective crossover, mutation and local search operators are designed, which can fully expand the solution space of the algorithm and improve its convergence speed. A total of 60 DFJSPC benchmark instances are constructed, and some comparative experiments are carried out among the proposed RMA and three well-known algorithms, namely NNIA, NSGA-II and NSGA-III. The final experimental results verified the outstanding performance of the RMA. This research will provide a theoretical basis for the order cancellation problem in distributed production settings, and help manufacturers to properly handle canceled orders to reduce resource waste and reschedule the infeasible schemes causing from order cancellation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem; Memetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Order cancellation","Benchmarking; Energy utilization; Job shop scheduling; Dynamic distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Makespan; Market changes; Memetic algorithms; Multi-objectives optimization; Order cancellations; Production environments; Resource wastes; Total energy; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (grant number: 72001217); the Nature Science Foundation of Hunan (grant number: 2021JJ41081; 2022JJ40860); the Hunan Provincial Department of Education Project (grant number: 22A0170); the Changsha Soft Science Research Program (grant number: kh2302004); the Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate (grant number: CX20220736); and the Scientific Innovation Fund for Post-graduates of Central South University of Forestry and Technology (grant number: 2023CX02078).","undefined, (2016); undefined, (1996); Baykasoğlu, Adil, Greedy randomized adaptive search for dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 56, pp. 425-451, (2020); Brandimarte, Paolo, Routing and scheduling in a flexible job shop by tabu search, Annals of Operations Research, 41, 3, pp. 157-183, (1993); Chan, Felix T.S., An adaptive genetic algorithm with dominated genes for distributed scheduling problems, Expert Systems with Applications, 29, 2, pp. 364-371, (2005); Chang, Haochin, Optimisation of distributed manufacturing flexible job shop scheduling by using hybrid genetic algorithms, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 28, 8, pp. 1973-1986, (2017); Chaudhry, Imran Ali, A research survey: Review of flexible job shop scheduling techniques, International Transactions in Operational Research, 23, 3, pp. 551-591, (2016); Coello, Carlos A., Solving multiobjective optimization problems using an artificial immune system, Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 6, 2, pp. 163-190, (2005); Dauzère–Pérès, Stéphane, Multi-resource shop scheduling with resource flexibility, European Journal of Operational Research, 107, 2, pp. 289-305, (1998); De Giovanni, Luigi, An Improved Genetic Algorithm for the Distributed and Flexible Job-shop Scheduling problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 200, 2, pp. 395-408, (2010)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171153800"

The BO-RF method establishes a nonlinear mapping function between the input variables and three targets, surface settlement, cutter wear, and advance speed, serving as the fitness function for NSGA-III. Model interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP). A multiobjective intelligent optimization model is formulated with NSGA-III, targeting surface settlement, cutter wear, and advance speed. A case study validates the applicability and effectiveness of this approach, leading to the following conclusions: (1) The BO-RF algorithm yields highly accurate prediction results, with R2 values ranging from 0.930 to 0.938, RMSE ranging from 0.138 to 0.172, and MAE ranging from 0.112 to 0.138 for the three targets. (2) The optimization results for surface settlement, cutter wear, and advance speed are outstanding, with an average improvement of 12.56 %.

Compared with other simple-level systems, the flexible multi-level picking system has a more complex coupling temporal relationship, which makes the scheduling optimization of shipbuilding automated collaborative order picking (SACOP) extremely difficult. In order to avoid the dilemma of finding a feasible and optimal collaborative scheduling scheme under the constraints of a complex temporal relationship, this paper proposed a multi-AGV-driven pallet-picking scheduling optimization (MADPSO) method, which takes the AGV scheduling scheme as the direct solution and modifies it to a feasible solution under the reasonably designed interaction strategy of stacker, AGV, and the interaction strategy of picking station, AGV. Furthermore, taking the minimum energy consumption and operation time as the optimization objectives, a multi-objective optimization mathematical model was established to describe MADPSO, and an improved NSGA-III algorithm was designed to solve the problem. Finally, several experiments were conducted in various scenarios and verified that using MADPSO can achieve a comprehensive optimization index improvement of 52.02–75.66% compared with traditional picking methods, which has a certain reference significance for shipyards. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","automated storage and retrieval system; improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; multi-objective optimization; pallet picking; parallel tasks scheduling; shipbuilding material management","","","","This research was funded by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People\u2019s Republic of China (No.2016543, No.2018473, and No.2019331), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 3072023CFJ0703).","Cardona, Manuel Napoleon, COVID-19 pandemic impact on mobile robotics market, (2020); İç, Yusuf Tansel, A Simplified Throughput Model for a Unit-Load AS/RS Considering Dynamics Principles, Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Systems, 21, 1, pp. 125-142, (2022); Ghomri, Latéfa, Modelling and optimisation of single-cycle time for mobile rack AS/RS, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 22, pp. 7685-7706, (2023); Hsu, Hsien Pin, Simulation-Based Optimization Approaches for Dealing with Dual-Command Crane Scheduling Problem in Unit-Load Double-Deep AS/RS Considering Energy Consumption, Mathematics, 10, 21, (2022); Hamzaoui, Mohammed Adel, Dual cycle time modelling and design optimisation for the bidirectional flow-rack AS/RS, International Journal of Production Research, 62, 13, pp. 4926-4956, (2024); Singbal, Vishwesh, Development of an open-source data-driven simulator for the unit-load multi-aisle automated storage and retrieval systems, Journal of Simulation, 18, 2, pp. 220-238, (2024); Yan, Qing, Travel time analysis and dimension optimisation design of double-ended compact storage system, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 20, pp. 6718-6745, (2023); Lehmann, Timo, Travel time model for multi-deep automated storage and retrieval systems with different storage strategies, International Journal of Production Research, 61, 16, pp. 5676-5691, (2023); Yan, Qing, A scheduling optimization method for stacker path in double-ended compact storage system, Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 15, 2, (2023); Geng, Sai, Research on scheduling strategy for automated storage and retrieval system, CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology, 7, 3, pp. 522-536, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192473756"

In this study on the LCMa-FJSP, a comprehensive scheduling model with four objectives, such as minimizing the completion time, total delay time, processing load rate of the bottleneck machine and total carbon emissions of the system is built. To solve this complex LCMa-FJSP, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) with three modified strategies, named IMOEA/D-HS, is proposed. First, a novel hybrid initialization strategy combining five heuristic methods is used to obtain a reliable initial population. Second, a new restart strategy that considers limited restarts is applied to reduce carbon emissions while protecting the lifetime of the machine. Third, a local reinforcement strategy is proposed that can efficiently improve the convergence of a part of sub-problems identified by distance and angle-based evaluation indicator (APD). To impartially and comprehensively analyze and evaluate the performance of IMOEA/D-HS, it is compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., MOEA/D-DRA, MOEA/DD, NSGA-III and RVEA on 15 numerical tests.

The machining parameters have significant effects on the formation of residual stress, it is important to predict the residual stress distribution with the cutting parameters and optimize the machining parameters to acquire the desirable residual profiles. Although many efforts of current studies have been paid to the prediction of residual stress profiles in different materials and machining processes, however, few works focused on residual stress in-depth profiles in the machining of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, and the optimization of cutting parameters for required residual stress profile has also rarely been reported. Therefore, this study proposed an integrated prediction model, which combines exponential decay cosine function (EDC), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and back propagation neural network (BP), to predict the in-depth residual stress profile of the machined surface in milling of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. Furthermore, according to the residual stress profile, the key features for describing the residual stress profile include the surface residual stress (SRS), maximum compressive residual stress (MCRS), depth of maximum compressive residual stress (DMCS), and depth of residual stress (DRS), were identified and analyzed. And a multiple objective optimization was conducted, where Kriging-based models were employed to establish the relationships between machining parameters and objectives (SRS and MCRS), and the MRR was also employed as an objective taking account of high production efficiency requirement. Finally, a two-stage optimization strategy integrating NSGA-III, MOPSO, and TOPSIS algorithms was used to address the multi-objective optimization model to obtain the expected residual stress profile and MRR.

The problem is modeled mathematically into mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) because the productivity metric is non-linear. The model is converted into a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP), so it can be solved using the hierarchical approach inside a solver. The development of the new problem model and study of the solver's performance is the first contribution to this proposal. Unfortunately, the solver is not practicable if the number of jobs is large, for example, 50 jobs only. Therefore, we proposed four metaheuristic techniques distinguished by their techniques and decoding schemes as the other contribution. We implement and modify two famous NSGA techniques, namely NSGA-II and NSGA-III, that each is equipped with two decoding scheme types which are D1 and D2. Both decoding schemes are different in the resource allocation sequence and the selection criterion. We compare the performance among metaheuristics by running them in 8 cases of small problems and 28 cases of large problems. The essential results indicate that both D1 and D2 are recommended to be implemented since D1 is more sensitive to the total tardiness objective, but D2 is better at getting solutions with better productivity metrics. Although there is no significant difference between NSGA-II and NSGA-III, we suggest using NSGA-III for practicians because it can spread solutions more balanced, indicating more varied alternatives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Labor productivity; MINLP; MIQP; MTSSDRC scheduling; NSGA-II; NSGA-III; Total tardiness","Constrained optimization; Decoding; Nonlinear programming; Dual resource constrained; Labour productivities; Mixed integer quadratic problems; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Multi tasks; Multi-task simultaneous supervision dual resource constrained scheduling; NSGA-II; NSGA-III; Resource constrained scheduling; Total tardiness; Integer programming","","","This research was funded by Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) in the program of ‘RISET ITB 2021’ organized by LPPM ITB.

Six CCHP scenarios based on three strategies are investigated for the energy utilization of the CCHP system. Also, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III using competition crossover and opposition-based learning (NSGA-III-CO) is proposed for the six scenarios. The competition crossover determines the starting point of search in the decision space, and more potential regions can be exploited sufficiently. The opposition-based learning (OBL) carries out random searches and facilitates the convergence of the population. In addition, a constraint handling approach (CHA) is presented to decrease the constraint violations of the infeasible individuals and turn them into feasible individuals, and it guarantees the feasibility of the population. Experimental results suggest that each CCHP scenario with PV/T is more efficient than the one with photovoltaic panel (PV) and the one neglecting PV/T and PV, and it achieves the lowest primary energy consumption, operation cost and carbon dioxide emission. Also, NSGA-III-CO and the other three algorithms are applied to the six CCHP scenarios with PV/T, and it obtains the highest hypervolume and coverage rate for each scenario. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined cooling, heating, and power system; Constraint handling approach; Energy utilization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm; Photovoltaic thermal collector","Carbon dioxide; Constraint handling; Cooling; Electric load dispatching; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Learning algorithms; Operating costs; Solar panels; Combined cooling heating and power; Combined cooling, heating, and power system; Constraint handling approach; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Opposition-based learning; Photovoltaic thermal collector; Photovoltaic thermals; Primary energy consumption; Thermal collectors; Energy utilization","","","This work was jointly supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61806058 ).","Abido, Mohammad A., Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for electric power dispatch problem, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 10, 3, pp. 315-329, (2006); Braunstein, Arie, ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC AND THERMAL (PVT) COLLECTOR., IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, EC-1, 4, pp. 31-33, (1986); Brown, Kristen M., An ecological study of the association between neighborhood racial and economic residential segregation with COVID-19 vulnerability in the United States’ capital city, Annals of Epidemiology, 59, pp. 33-36, (2021); Chen, Lan, A knowledge-based NSGA-II algorithm for multi-objective hot rolling production scheduling under flexible time-of-use electricity pricing, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 69, pp. 255-270, (2023); Chen, Jie, Economic and environmental operation of power systems including combined cooling, heating, power and energy storage resources using developed multi-objective grey wolf algorithm, Applied Energy, 298, (2021); Chen, Jianhong, Strategic integration of vehicle-to-home system with home distributed photovoltaic power generation in Shanghai, Applied Energy, 263, (2020); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Mahapatra, Sheila, A novel ameliorated Harris hawk optimizer for solving complex engineering optimization problems, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 36, 12, pp. 7641-7681, (2021); Emmanuel, Michael, A review of power system planning and operational models for flexibility assessment in high solar energy penetration scenarios, Solar Energy, 210, pp. 169-180, (2020); Catalog of Chp Technologies, (2008)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09521976","","EAAIE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177999068"

These challenges not only hinder the computational efficiency and generalizability of anomaly detection systems but also compromise their ability to detect rare attack types, posing significant security threats. To address these pressing issues, we propose a novel causal genetic network-based anomaly detection method, the CNSGA, which integrates causal inference and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III). The CNSGA leverages causal reasoning to exclude irrelevant information, focusing solely on the features that are causally related to the outcome labels. Simultaneously, NSGA-III iteratively eliminates redundant information and prioritizes minority samples, thereby enhancing detection performance. To quantitatively assess the improvements achieved, we introduce two indices: a detection balance index and an optimal feature subset index. These indices, along with the causal effect weights, serve as fitness metrics for iterative optimization. The optimized individuals are then selected for subsequent population generation on the basis of nondominated reference point ordering. The experimental results obtained with four real-world network attack datasets demonstrate that the CNSGA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of overall precision, the imbalance index, and the optimal feature subset index, with maximum increases exceeding 10%, 0.5, and 50%, respectively. Notably, for the CICDDoS2019 dataset, the CNSGA requires only 16-dimensional features to effectively detect more than 70% of all sample types, including 6 more network attack sample types than the other methods detect. The significance and impact of this work encompass the ability to eliminate redundant information, increase detection rates, balance attack detection systems, and ensure stability and generalizability. The proposed CNSGA framework represents a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate anomaly detection systems capable of defending against a wide range of cyber threats in complex network environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal genetics; causal intervention; detection balance; network anomaly detection; optimal feature subset","Anomaly detection methods; Causal genetic; Causal intervention; Detection balance; Feature subset; Genetic networks; Information redundancies; Network anomaly detection; Network environments; Optimal feature subset; Genetic algorithms","","","This work is supported by Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 2023JJ50490, 2023JJ30696, 2021JJ40158), the Research Projects for Teaching Reform in Hunan Province's Regular Colleges and Universities (no. 202401001443), the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (no.62172441, 62172449, 62373372, 62202160), the Joint Funds for Railway Fundamental Research of National Natural Science Foundation of China (no.

In addition, there is a wide variety of intermediate parts in the production process, which is prone to the problem of kitting and long waiting times. The traditional single-stage scheduling made it difficult to achieve overall production optimization. Furthermore, due to the large size of the workpiece, transportation equipment also consumes a significant amount of energy and generates carbon emissions during transportation. In heterogeneous hybrid flowshop, there is significant potential for optimizing the collaborative scheduling between processing machines and transportation equipment as well as between different transportation devices. This study presents a green scheduling model that considers the optimization of both the maximum makespan and the carbon emissions generated by the processing machines and transport equipment. The model also takes into account the idle state of the processing machines to further reduce carbon emissions. A green scheduling strategy is proposed to solve this model, along with an enhanced NSGA-III (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) that integrates the Moth-Flame Optimization algorithm. Additionally, 15 arithmetic examples are provided to illustrate the manufacturing process of large metallic components of different scales. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through comparisons with commonly used intelligent optimization algorithms and non-collaborative scheduling. The findings highlight the efficacy of collaborative scheduling in the heterogeneous multi-stage hybrid flowshop for large metallic components, resulting in reduced manufacturing time and carbon emissions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","collaborative scheduling; crane transportation; green scheduling; large metallic component; NSGA-III","Linear programming; Carbon emissions; Collaborative scheduling; Crane transportation; Green scheduling; Hybrid flow shop; Large metallic component; Metallic component; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Processing machines; Green manufacturing","","","","Abderrahim, Moussa, Bi-local search based variable neighborhood search for job-shop scheduling problem with transport constraints, Optimization Letters, 16, 1, pp. 255-280, (2022); Alvarez-Meaza, Izaskun, Green scheduling to achieve green manufacturing: Pursuing a research agenda by mapping science, Technology in Society, 67, (2021); Chen, Jian, A cooperative approach to service booking and scheduling in cloud manufacturing, European Journal of Operational Research, 273, 3, pp. 861-873, (2019); Duan, Jianguo, Energy-efficient collaborative scheduling of heterogeneous multi-stage hybrid flowshop for large metallic component manufacturing, Journal of Cleaner Production, 375, (2022); Duan, Jianguo, Energy-efficient scheduling for a flexible job shop with machine breakdowns considering machine idle time arrangement and machine speed level selection, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 161, (2021); Duan, Jianguo, Robust scheduling for flexible machining job shop subject to machine breakdowns and new job arrivals considering system reusability and task recurrence, Expert Systems with Applications, 203, (2022); Duan, Jianguo, Sustainable scheduling optimization of mixed-line production for large marine power components, Journal of Cleaner Production, 280, (2021); Feng, Kai, A study on deep reinforcement learning-based crane scheduling model for uncertainty tasks, High Temperature Materials and Processes, 41, 1, pp. 469-481, (2022); Feng, Yixiong, Integrated intelligent green scheduling of sustainable flexible workshop with edge computing considering uncertain machine state, Journal of Cleaner Production, 246, (2020); Fontes, Dalila Benedita M.Martins, Job-shop scheduling-joint consideration of production, transport, and storage/retrieval systems, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 44, 2, pp. 1284-1322, (2022)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","14753995; 09696016","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212492620"

To solve this model, an enhanced version of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III integrated with a neighbourhood search strategy (NSGA-III-LS) is proposed. The chromosome decoding process was reframed as a one-dimensional binning problem, enabling the rapid calculation of workstation cycle times for determining the relationship between processes and workstations. The experimental results and real-world case studies validate the effectiveness of NSGA-III-LS. It was found that the multi-objective model effectively balances diverse objectives and promotes sustainable production. Moreover, the model considering varying skill levels outperforms the model with fixed skill levels in terms of the balance rate.

Traditional methods often struggle to balance patient preferences, hospital constraints, and varying patient loads. This study explores the III genetic algorithm without dominant sorting with variable length (VL-NSGA III) for dynamic patient scheduling and compares it with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), Objective Decomposition Particle Swarm Optimization (ODPSO), and Genetic Algorithm without Dominant Sorting II with Best Fitness Evaluation (Nsga2bfe). The problem formulation considers dynamic patient arrivals and hospital constraints, requiring flexible solutions. VL-NSGA III generates high-quality non-dominant solutions tailored to dynamic scheduling scenarios. The evaluation used simulator-based scoring over a 36-day period, with synthetic patient data simulating real hospital conditions. The simulation modeled a hospital with multiple departments, specializations, and rooms, considering factors such as room capacity, patient arrival rates, and service duration. Evaluation metrics included set coverage (C-metric) to assess dominance among solution sets, hypervolume (HV) to measure objective space coverage, and convergence to measure proximity to the true Pareto front. The study ran multiple simulation scenarios with varying patient arrival rates, service durations, and hospital capacities to test the algorithm's robustness and adaptability. The results showed that VL-NSGA III excelled at generating non-dominated solutions with superior set coverage, achieving a value of 1 against PSO, MOPSO, ODPSO, and Nsga2bfe, indicating complete dominance. ODPSO achieved the highest hypervolume, closely followed by MOPSO and PSO. Notably, MOPSO demonstrated partial dominance over PSO with 0.7 coverage and over ODPSO with 0.8333. ODPSO showed partial dominance over PSO and MOPSO with coverage values of 0.6333 and 0.7333, respectively. Nsga2bfe exhibited partial dominance over VL-NSGA III with a coverage value of 0.03333 while fully dominating PSO and MOPSO. The dominant set coverage of VL-NSGA III highlighted its robustness and adaptability in dynamic patient scheduling scenarios, despite lower hypervolume values compared to ODPSO, MOPSO, and PSO. This underscores the importance of considering both set coverage and hypervolume metrics when evaluating algorithm performance for complex scheduling problems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dynamic; hospital admission and scheduling; many objective optimization; multi-objective optimization; non-dominated optimization; patients’ admission scheduling","Arthroplasty; Benchmarking; Electrotherapeutics; Frequency allocation; Hospital data processing; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Risk management; Scheduling algorithms; Stochastic programming; Hospital admission and scheduling; Hospital admissions; Many-objective optimizations; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated optimization; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Patient admissions; Patient’ admission scheduling; Swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","","e Oliveira, B.

By enhancing vehicle routing and bin packing strategies, the approach targets the reduction of logistics distribution costs and increases in vehicle loading rates, ultimately enhancing the cost-effectiveness of distribution operations. The performance of IPSO-NSGA-III is rigorously evaluated through multi-objective function testing and a detailed case study, where it is compared against other state-of-the-art algorithms. The case study results show that, the IPSO-NSGA-III outperforms the NSGA-III by delivering more effective solutions that consider the interplay between vehicle routing and bin packing.

In order to enhance the efficacy of ship arrival and departure scheduling, a scheduling model is developed with the objective of minimizing the total scheduling time and minimizing the total waiting time of the ship. Furthermore, an enhanced three-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-III, is proposed as a solution to the ship scheduling model. The improved NSGA-III algorithm employs the Metropolis criterion in the simulated annealing algorithm in conjunction with the small habitat technique to optimize the initial population of NSGA-III. Additionally, it utilizes a multi-objective parallel strategy and an adaptive cross-variation strategy to enhance the convergence ability and robustness of NSGA-III, thereby preventing it from falling into a local optimum. The improved NSGA-III is employed to resolve the scheduling model under disparate operational conditions within the primary channel of Tianjin Port. The algorithm's efficacy is evaluated in comparison to the classical NSGA-II and NSGA-III algorithms. The results show that the im-proved NSGA-III algorithm is better than the NSGA-II and NSGA-III algorithms. The optimal scheduling plan for ship entry and exit in the main channel of Tianjin Port and the sequence of ship arrival and departure scheduling were obtained by Pareto solving set and combining with Topsis evaluation method. The method proposed in this paper offers a novel approach to the optimization of ship arrival and departure scheduling. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","NSGA-III algorithm; Scheduling model; Tianjin Port; waterway transport","Genetic algorithms; Marine navigation; Pareto principle; Scheduling algorithms; Ships; Waterway transportation; NSGA-II; NSGA-III algorithm; Port resource; Scheduling methods; Scheduling models; Three generations; Tianjin ports; Waiting time; Waterway navigation; Waterway transport; Simulated annealing","","","","Wu, Zhizheng, Application of a deep learning-based discrete weather data continuousization model in ship route optimization, Ocean Engineering, 285, (2023); Lin, Haonan, An analysis of port congestion alleviation strategy based on system dynamics, Ocean and Coastal Management, 229, (2022); Journal of Dalian Maritime University, (2008); Computer Engineering and Applications, (2025); Liu, Dongdong, Fuzzy scheduling problem of vessels in one-way waterway, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 9, 10, (2021); Hill, Alessandro, A multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling reformulation for the waterway ship scheduling problem, Journal of Scheduling, 22, 2, pp. 173-182, (2019); Zohoori, Sepideh, Quantifying Wide-Body Vessel Navigation Delay in Narrow Waterways: A Case Study at the Houston Ship Channel, Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering, 148, 4, (2022); Journal of Computer Applications, (2021); Zhang, Jinfen, Sequential ship traffic scheduling model for restricted two-way waterway transportation, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part M: Journal of Engineering for the Maritime Environment, 231, 1, pp. 86-97, (2017); Zhang, Teng, A new and practical numerical calculation method for time-domain Green function, Dalian Haishi Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Dalian Maritime University, 44, 1, pp. 1-8, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204120593"

This is due to the need for incorporating expertise from different domains as well as the increased number and complexity of components integrated into the product. To alleviate the burden of designing such products, many industries and researchers are attracted to the concept of modularization which is to identify a subset of system components that can form a module. To achieve this, a novel product-related dependency management approach is proposed in this paper with the support of an augmented design structure matrix. This approach makes it possible to model positive and negative dependencies and to compute the combination potency between components to form modules. This approach is then integrated into a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III to concurrently optimize the design and identify the modules. The methodology is exemplified through the case study of a layout design of an automatic greenhouse.

Since the leakage impedance affects the short-circuit current, magnetic leakage distribution, and manufacturing cost, the accurate calculation of transformer impedance is vital for transformer design. Generally, leakage impedance is mainly decided by the design parameters of the windings, both analytically and numerically. In most given literature studies, the leakage impedance was optimized and analyzed by adjusting the design parameters of the windings without considering the consequent influence on transformer loss and manufacturing costs. A multiobjective optimization model considering the leakage impedance, manufacturing cost, and operating loss of the windings is presented in this paper. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is built using 2048 finite-element analysis (FEA) samples and utilized as a leakage impedance predictor. XGBoost shows better accuracy and consumes much less time compared to analytical and FEA methods. Subsequently, the presented multiobjective model is optimized using multiobjective algorithms and the NSGA-III shows the best performance among the NSGA-II, MOPSO, and MODE. The results show that the leakage impedance is closer to the required value. Besides, the winding manufacturing cost and loss are meanly decreased by 4.7% and 4.1%, respectively, in the engineering case. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Cost engineering; Distribution transformers; Magnetic leakage; Design parameters; Energy transmission; Finite element analyse; Leakage distribution; Leakage impedances; Manufacturing cost; Optimisations; Power; Short-circuit currents; Transformers winding; Transformer windings","","","","Zhou, Changduo, Analysis of Core Loss Characteristics of Linear Phase-Shifting Transformer, Energy Reports, 9, pp. 702-711, (2023); Jurković, Zvonimir, Fast Hybrid Approach for Calculation of Losses in Outer Packages of Transformer Core Due to Perpendicular Stray Flux, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 57, 6, (2021); Dawood, Kamran, Optimization and analysis of tapping position on leakage reactance of a two winding transformer, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 69, pp. 363-369, (2023); Sobrinho, Adelicio Maximiano, Multiobjective Optimization Techniques Applied to Three-Phase Transformers Designs, IEEE Latin America Transactions, 20, 3, pp. 386-394, (2022); Adly, A.

It is a comprehensive two-stage scenario-based stochastic optimization model to incorporate the system uncertainties associated with wind power generations along with load demands. In this multi-objective framework, two competing objective functions as the expected total payment functions for energy and reactive power ancillary services are simultaneously minimized while satisfying all the system operating constraints including technical as well as market driven constraints. An efficient hybrid payment strategy is designed for energy market as well as reactive power ancillary service market for creating a competitive and fair market auction. A pay-As-bid payment mechanism is adopted for all thermal generating units whereas a pay-At-MCP (Market Clearing Price) is adopted for all hydro-powered generating units and wind farms for the energy market settlement. However, the ancillary service market of reactive power is settled using uniform price payment mechanism. It is a unique market settlement model, which combines three significant complexities such as stochastic nature, multi-objective constrained optimization, and meta-heuristics. The proposed MOSMS-CERP model is examined by applying five well-known, recent, and advanced meta-heuristic methods such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA-II & I-NSGA-III), Multi-Objective Keshtel Algorithm (MOKA), Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (HFMOEA), and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) for producing the sets of Pareto-optimal solutions. A fair statistical comparison is carryout for these five meta-heuristic methods based on No Free Launch Theorem. All simulations are conducted on a standard IEEE 24-bus RTS with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farm on a DIgSILENT Power Factory software platform. The obtained simulation results ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed MOSMS-CERP model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coupled market settlement model; DFIG based wind farm; energy market; grid-integration of wind energy; market clearing price; payment mechanism; reactive power ancillary service market; uniform price","Asynchronous generators; Boundary integral equations; Boundary value problems; Competition; Critical path analysis; Decomposition methods; Dynamic programming; Earnings; Electric manufacturing plants; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Linear programming; Linearization; Monte Carlo methods; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Numerical methods; Pareto principle; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Polynomial approximation; Power markets; Random processes; Stability criteria; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; System stability; Wind power integration; Ancillary services markets; Coupled market settlement model; Coupled markets; Doubly fed induction generators; Doubly feed induction generator based wind farm; Energy; Energy markets; Grid integration; Grid-integration of wind energy; Load modeling; Market Clearing Price; Payment mechanism; Power; Reactive power ancillary service market; Reactive power ancillary services; Settlement models; Stochastics; Uncertainty; Uniform price; Wind farm; Constrained optimization","","","This work was supported by the Researchers Supporting Project at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, under Project RSP-2021/278.","Ellabban, Omar, Renewable energy resources: Current status, future prospects and their enabling technology, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 39, pp. 748-764, (2014); Zhong, Jin, Toward a competitive market for reactive power, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 17, 4, pp. 1206-1215, (2002); Pathak, A.

This research presents a novel approach to feature selection, a critical aspect of enhancing machine learning model efficiency, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets. By integrating the Flamingo Search Algorithm (FSA), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), and Regularised Extreme Learning Machine (RELM), the proposed method addresses limitations in existing feature selection and multi-objective optimisation algorithms. Leveraging FSA’s emulation of flamingo behaviours, the approach achieves a balance between global exploration and local exploitation, mitigating issues like premature convergence and local optima. Integration with NSGA-III enhances multi-objective optimisation capabilities, maintaining a delicate equilibrium between convergence and diversity. FSA-RELM is employed for accurate feature assessment, given its rapid learning and suitability for large datasets with multiple labels.

Central to our approach is the strategic placement of maintenance stations and the efficient allocation of personnel, addressing a crucial gap in the integration of maintenance personnel dispatching and station selection. Our model uniquely combines the spatial distribution of machinery with the expertise of operators to achieve a harmonious balance between maintenance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The core of our methodology is the NSGA III+ Dispatch, an advanced adaptation of the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), meticulously designed for the selection of maintenance stations and effective operator dispatching. This method integrates a comprehensive coding process, crossover operator, and mutation operator to efficiently manage multiple objectives. Rigorous empirical testing, including a detailed analysis from a Taiwanese electronic equipment manufacturer, validated the effectiveness of our approach across various scenarios of machine failure frequencies and operator configurations. The findings reveal that the proposed model significantly outperforms current practices by reducing response times by up to 23% in low-frequency and 28.23% in high-frequency machine failure scenarios, leading to notable improvements in efficiency and cost reduction. Additionally, it demonstrates significant improvements in operational efficiency, particularly in selective high-frequency failure contexts, while ensuring substantial manpower cost savings without compromising on operational effectiveness. This research significantly advances maintenance strategies in production environments, providing the manufacturing industry with practical, optimized solutions for diverse machine malfunction situations.

Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) algorithms play a crucial role in this process by enabling them to navigate these trade-offs effectively. This capability is essential for solving complex problems across diverse scientific and engineering domains, where achieving optimal solutions often requires balancing multiple objectives. One of these MOO algorithms Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) extends it to handle problems with multiple objectives simultaneously, but like many swarm-based algorithms, MOPSO can suffer from premature convergence or local optima solutions. Therefore, this article introduces a novel Multi-Exemplar Particle Swarm Optimization with Local Awareness (MEPSOLA) as a potent solution. The algorithm presents a developed multi-objective-aware criterion for multi-exemplar selection, adeptly balancing exploration and exploitation to avoid local optima and enhance performance across multiple objectives. It also introduces a conditional and periodic Tabu search tailored specifically for exemplar selection enhancement, improving both exploration and exploitation capabilities and avoiding premature convergence. Additionally, our method employs an improved initialization phase using equal sampling for each decision variable to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the entire solution space. A comprehensive assessment utilizing standard mathematical functions such as Fonseca-Fleming (FON), Kursawe (KUR), ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, and ZDT6, and a comparison with state-of-the-art benchmarks in the field such as the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA), Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), and NSGA-III, validate the efficiency of MEPSOLA. Notably, MEPSOLA's solutions outperform other benchmarks in key metrics across the majority of mathematical problems, for instance in set coverage, where our method dominates other methods' solutions by 99.22%, 69%, and 93.58 %, respectively, highlighting its enhanced capability in optimizing capability within complex multi-objective optimization scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","complex optimization landscapes; local search; MOPSO; multi-exemplar; Multi-objective optimization; multi-objective particle swarm optimization; Tabu search","Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Problem solving; Tabu search; Benchmark testing; Complex optimization; Complex optimization landscape; Convergence; Local search; Machine learning algorithms; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Multi-exemplar; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Search problem; Swarm optimization; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Zaman, Hamid Reza Rafat, An improved particle swarm optimization with backtracking search optimization algorithm for solving continuous optimization problems, Engineering with Computers, 38, pp. 2797-2831, (2022); Noori, Mustafa Sabah, Feature Drift Aware for Intrusion Detection System Using Developed Variable Length Particle Swarm Optimization in Data Stream, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 128596-128617, (2023); Nadimi-Shahraki, Mohammad H., Ewoa-opf: Effective whale optimization algorithm to solve optimal power flow problem, Electronics (Switzerland), 10, 23, (2021); Mendonça, Gustavo H.M., Multi-attribute decision making applied to financial portfolio optimization problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 158, (2020); Huang, Shanhuen, Solving the vehicle routing problem with drone for delivery services using an ant colony optimization algorithm, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 51, (2022); Arora, Sankalap, Binary butterfly optimization approaches for feature selection, Expert Systems with Applications, 116, pp. 147-160, (2019); Rostami, Mehrdad, Integration of multi-objective PSO based feature selection and node centrality for medical datasets, Genomics, 112, 6, pp. 4370-4384, (2020); Morales-Hernandez, Alejandro, A survey on multi-objective hyperparameter optimization algorithms for machine learning, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 8, pp. 8043-8093, (2023); Saini, Naveen Kumar, Multi-objective optimization techniques: a survey of the state-of-the-art and applications: Multi-objective optimization techniques, European Physical Journal: Special Topics, 230, 10, pp. 2319-2335, (2021); Gad, Ahmed G., Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Its Applications: A Systematic Review, Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, 29, 5, pp. 2531-2561, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198312687"

Nowadays, we can make our factories smarter using new concepts and tools like real-time self-optimization. This study aims to take a step towards implementing key features of smart manufacturing including preventive self-maintenance, self-scheduling and real-time decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: A new bi-objective mathematical model based on Industry 4.0 to schedule received customer orders, which minimizes both the total earliness and tardiness of orders and the probability of machine failure in smart manufacturing, was presented. Moreover, four meta-heuristics, namely, the multi-objective Archimedes optimization algorithm (MOAOA), NSGA-III, multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) and hybrid multi-objective Archimedes optimization algorithm and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (HMOAOANSGA-III) were implemented to solve the problem. To compare the performance of meta-heuristics, some examples and metrics were presumed and solved by using the algorithms, and the performance and validation of meta-heuristics were analyzed. Findings: The results of the procedure and a mathematical model based on Industry 4.0 policies showed that a machine performed the self-optimizing process of production scheduling and followed a preventive self-maintenance policy in real-time situations. The results of TOPSIS showed that the performances of the HMOAOANSGA-III were better in most problems. Moreover, the performance of the MOSA outweighed the performance of the MOAOA, NSGA-III and HMOAOANSGA-III if we only considered the computational times of algorithms. However, the convergence of solutions associated with the MOAOA and HMOAOANSGA-III was better than those of the NSGA-III and MOSA. Originality/value: In this study, a scheduling model considering a kind of Industry 4.0 policy was defined, and a novel approach was presented, thereby performing the preventive self-maintenance and self-scheduling by every single machine.

Existing related studies exhibit a limited consideration of workload distribution and involve the violation of precedence constraints in the solution process. This study proposes a CTAS method to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The method defines visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor (VACP) load balancing objectives and integrates them with workload balancing and minimum task completion time to ensure equitable workload distribution and task execution efficiency, and then a multi-objective optimization model for CTAS is constructed. Subsequently, it designs a population initialization strategy and a repair mechanism to maintain sequence feasibility, and utilizes them to improve the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) for solving the CTAS model. Findings: The CTAS method is validated through a numerical example involving a mission with a specific type of armored vehicle. The results demonstrate that the method achieves equitable workload distribution by integrating VACP load balancing and workload balancing. Moreover, the improved NSGA-III maintains sequence feasibility and thus reduces computation time. Originality/value: The study can achieve equitable workload distribution and enhance the search efficiency of the optimal CTAS scheme. It provides a novel perspective for task planners in objective determination and solution methodologies for CTAS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Population initialization strategy; Repair mechanism; Sequence feasibility; Task allocation and sequencing; Workload distribution","Armored vehicles; Genetic algorithms; Interactive computer systems; Military vehicles; Multiobjective optimization; Numerical methods; Repair; Allocation methods; Population initialization strategy; Population initializations; Repair mechanism; Sequence feasibility; Sequencing method; Task allocation; Task completion time; Task sequencing; Work-load distribution; Efficiency","","","The authors would like to thank the support given by the 111 Project, Grant No.B13044.","Afshar-Nadjafi, Behrouz, Multi-skilling in scheduling problems: A review on models, methods and applications, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 151, (2021); Aggarwal, Ambika, Self adaptive fruit fly algorithm for multiple workflow scheduling in cloud computing environment, Kybernetes, 50, 6, pp. 1704-1730, (2020); Amer, Noor Hafizah, Adaptive modified Stanley controller with fuzzy supervisory system for trajectory tracking of an autonomous armoured vehicle, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 105, pp. 94-111, (2018); Aslani, Babak, Learn to decompose multiobjective optimization models for large-scale networks, International Transactions in Operational Research, 31, 2, pp. 949-978, (2024); Bǎrbulescu, Alina, Computing the beta parameter in idw interpolation by using a genetic algorithm, Water (Switzerland), 13, 6, (2021); Cheewapongpan, Janyaporn, An Economical Approach for Disassembly Sequence Planning, pp. 92-96, (2019); Chen, Kesong, Synthesis of sparse planar arrays using modified real genetic algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 55, 4, pp. 1067-1073, (2007); Methods for Modeling and Optimizing Military Mission Plans, (2019); Chen, Chen, Member combination selection for product collaborative design under the open innovation model, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 55, (2023); Chutima, Parames, Many-objective low-cost airline cockpit crew rostering optimisation, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 150, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","0368492X","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194547537"

Our model utilizes a combination of Temporal Production Simulation and an Enhanced Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III to address the challenge associated with fluctuating energy demands and renewable sources integration. The model represents a significant advancement in energy planning due to its capacity to simulate energy production and consumption dynamics over time. The unique feature of the model is based on Temporal Production Simulation, meaning that the model is capable of accounting for hourly, daily, and seasonal fluctuations in energy supply and demand. Such temporal sensitivity is crucial for optimization in systems with high percentages of intermittent renewable sources, as existing planning solutions largely ignore such fluctuations. Another component of the model is the Enhanced NSGA-III algorithm that is uniquely tailored for the nature of multi-objective energy planning where one must balance their cost, environmental performance, and reliability. We have developed improvements to NSGAIII to enhance its efficiency when navigating the complex decision space associated with energy planning to reach faster convergence and to explore more optimal solutions. Methodologically, we use a combination of in-depth problem definition approach, advanced simulation, and algorithmic adjustments. We have validated our model against existing models and testing it in various scenarios to illustrate its superior ability to reach optimal energy plans based on efficiency, sustainability, and reliability under various conditions. Overall, through its unique incorporation of the Temporal Production Simulation and an improved optimization algorithm, the Energy Planning Model provides novel insights and practical decision support for policymakers and energy planners developed to reach the optimal sustainable solutions required for the high penetration of renewables. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Planning; Enhanced NSGA-III; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms; Optimization; Temporal Production Simulation","Ability testing; Decision support systems; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Environmental management; Sustainable development; Energy; Energy planning; Enhanced NSGA-III; Innovative models; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Optimisations; Planning models; Production simulation; Renewable sources; Temporal production simulation; Genetic algorithms","","","","Yu, Jinghao, Multi-objective optimization configuration of wind-solar-storage microgrid based on NSGA-III, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 2005, 1, (2021); Chi, Yuqi, Multi-Objective Joint Planning Method of Distributed Photovoltaic and Battery Energy Storage System Based on NSGA-III Algorithm, pp. 940-945, (2022); Teo, Tiong Teck, Optimization of fuzzy energy-management system for grid-connected microgrid using NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 51, 11, pp. 5375-5386, (2021); Elarbi, Maha, On the importance of isolated infeasible solutions in the many-objective constrained NSGA-III, Knowledge-Based Systems, 227, (2021); Nsga III Based Timecostenvironmental Impact Trade Off Optimization Model for Construction Projects, (2022); Peng, Wuliang, A bi-objective hierarchical program scheduling problem and its solution based on NSGA-III, Annals of Operations Research, 308, 1-2, pp. 389-414, (2022); Cui, Zhihua, Improved NSGA-III with selection-and-elimination operator, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 49, pp. 23-33, (2019); Wu, Xiuli, NSGA-III for solving dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem considering deterioration effect, IET Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing, 2, 1, pp. 22-33, (2020); Moreno-Rodríguez, Salvador, Prediction of energy consumption in a NSGA-II-based evolutionary algorithm, pp. 239-240, (2018); Chebouba, Billal Nazim, System Reliability and Cost Optimization under Various Scenarios Using NSGA-III, (2020)","","European Alliance for Innovation","","","","","","2032944X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193472114"

However, in the context of expensive constrained multi-objective optimization problems (ECMOPs) with complex feasible regions, guiding the optimization algorithm towards the constrained Pareto optimal front and achieving a balance between feasibility, convergence, diversity, exploration, and exploitation using a single infill criterion pose significant challenges. We propose an ensemble infill criterion-based multi-stage SAEA (EIC-MSSAEA) to tackle these challenges. Specifically, EIC-MSSAEA comprises three stages. In the first stage, we ignore constraints to facilitate the rapid traversal of infeasible obstacles. In the second stage, only one constraint is activated at a time to increase algorithm diversity. Finally, in the last stage, we activate all constraints to improve overall feasibility. In each stage, EIC-MSSAEA first employs NSGA-III as the underlying baseline solver to explore the search space, in which promising solutions are then selected by an ensemble infill criterion that incorporates multiple base-infill criteria to measure the feasibility, convergence, diversity, and uncertainty of candidate solutions. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of EIC-MSSAEA against state-of-the-art SAEAs for ECMOPs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained multi-objective optimization; Convergence; ensemble infill criterion; evolutionary algorithm; Evolutionary computation; expensive evaluations; Iron; Linear programming; multi-stage SAEA; Optimization; Pareto optimization; Vectors","Constrained optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Infill drilling; Iron; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Convergence; Ensemble infill criteria; Expensive evaluation; Linear-programming; Multi-stage surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm; Multi-stages; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Pareto-optimization; Linear programming","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193256655"

In NSGA-III, DPF regeneration temperature (T4 and T5), O2,NOx, smoke, and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) are optimized by adjusting the engine injection control parameters. An improved seagull optimization algorithm (ISOA) is proposed to enhance the accuracy of BPNN predictions. The ISOA-BP diesel engine regeneration condition prediction model is established to evaluate fitness. The optimized fuel injection parameters are programmed into the engine's electronic control unit (ECU) for experimental validation through steady-state testing, DPF active regeneration testing, and WHTC transient cycle testing. The results demonstrate that the introduced ISOA algorithm exhibits faster convergence and improved search abilities, effectively addressing calculation accuracy challenges. A comparison between the SOA-BPNN and ISOA-BPNN models shows the superior accuracy of the latter, with reduced errors and improved R2 values. The optimization method, integrating NSGA-III and ISOA-BPNN, achieves multiobjective calibration for T4 and T5 temperatures. Steady-state testing reveals average increases of 3.14%, 2.07%, and 10.79% in T4, T5, and exhaust oxygen concentrations, while NOx, smoke, and BSFC exhibit average decreases of 8.68%, 12.07%, and 1.03%. Regeneration experiments affirm the efficiency of the proposed method, with DPF regeneration reaching 88.2% and notable improvements in T4, T5, and oxygen concentrations during WHTC transient testing. This research provides a promising and effective solution for calibrating the regeneration temperature of DPF, thus reducing emissions and fuel consumption of diesel engines while ensuring safe and efficient DPF regeneration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Backpropagation; Control systems; Diesel engines; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Oxygen; Back-propagation neural networks; Condition; Diesel particulate filters; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization algorithms; Optimization method; Oxygen concentrations; Regeneration temperature; Specific fuel consumption; Steady state; Smoke","","","","Duan, Xiongbo, Experimental study the effects of various compression ratios and spark timing on performance and emission of a lean-burn heavy-duty spark ignition engine fueled with methane gas and hydrogen blends, Energy, 169, pp. 558-571, (2019); Eslami, Mohammad Javad, Investigating and optimizing the mixture of hydrogen-biodiesel and nano-additive on emissions of the engine equipped with exhaust gas recirculation, Biofuels, 14, 5, pp. 473-484, (2023); Tamilvanan, A., Enhancement of energy conversion and emission reduction of Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel in diesel engine using reactivity controlled compression ignition strategy and TOPSIS optimization, Energy, 264, (2023); van Dooren, Stijn, A causal supervisory control strategy for optimal control of a heavy-duty Diesel engine with SCR aftertreatment, Control Engineering Practice, 119, (2022); McCaffery, Cavan, Evaluation of small off-road diesel engine emissions and aftertreatment systems, Energy, 251, (2022); Bermúdez, Vicente R., Assessment by means of gas dynamic modelling of a pre-turbo diesel particulate filter configuration in a turbocharged HSDI diesel engine under full-load transient operation, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 225, 9, pp. 1134-1155, (2011); Wang, Yuhua, Combining GA-SVM and NSGA-Ⅲ multi-objective optimization to reduce the emission and fuel consumption of high-pressure common-rail diesel engine, Energy, 278, (2023); R, Sakthivel Periya, Optimization of performance and emission characteristics of compression ignition engine powered with Azolla pinnata fuel blends–A response surface methodology approach, Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, 47, 1, pp. 7635-7644, (2025); Nox Emission Control Technologies in Stationary and Automotive Internal Combustion Engines, (2022); Taghavifar, Hadi, 1D diesel engine cycle modeling integrated with MOPSO optimization for improved NOx control and pressure boost, Energy, 247, (2022)","","Wiley-Hindawi","","","","","","1098111X; 08848173","","IJISE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190721555"

A scenario of new vehicle routing is analyzed in which customers are asked to provide alternative time windows to offer flexibility to help route planners find more fuel-efficient routes (“green delivery”). Customers can rank their preferred time windows as first, second, and third. The optimization model aims to reduce tour costs, promote electromobility over fossil fuels, such as diesel, and meet customer preferences when possible and affordable. The study incorporates a multi-objective optimization model with three objectives, which are overall cost, use of fossil fuel, and customer satisfaction. For the new problem, a set of realistic benchmark problems is created and four mainstream solvers are applied for the Pareto front approximation: NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and SMS-EMOA. These algorithms are compared in terms of their effectiveness in achieving the objectives of minimizing travel costs, promoting electromobility, and meeting customer preferences. The study uses five different problems of single-vehicle route planning. Two major findings are that the selection of the metaheuristic can make a big difference in terms of algorithm performance. The resulting 3-D Pareto fronts reveal the nature of this new class of problems: Interestingly, in the new model with flexible time windows, most users can still be delivered in their most preferred time windows with only small concessions to the other objectives. However, using only one time window per user can lead to an increasingly drastic cost and fossil fuel consumption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Customer satisfaction; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Sales; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Customer preferences; Electromobility; Flexible time windows; Heuristic solutions; Model solution; Multi-objectives optimization; Pareto front; Routing problems; Solution algorithms; Time windows; Fossil fuels","","","The work was supported by the Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu [1059B192202739].

Developing efficient event sequencing algorithms is a research priority to enhance the performance of blockchain systems. This study addresses the efficiency problem in blockchain event sequencing by introducing a high-dimensional multi-objective differential evolution strategy to improve blockchain technology’s performance in various fields. This paper uses the NSGA-III-WA algorithm to efficiently sort blockchain events by combining differential evolution strategies. Compared to the traditional sorting algorithm, this algorithm reduces latency by 30% and improves memory usage by about 20% when dealing with events of the same size, ensuring sorting accuracy. By optimizing the weight vector adjustment strategy, the convergence speed and distribution uniformity of the algorithm and the solution can be optimized. In this paper, the algorithm can effectively improve the efficiency and performance of blockchain event processing, which is critical in optimizing blockchain systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Event sequencing; High-dimensional multi-objective differential evolution; NSGA-III-WA algorithm","Efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Sorting; Supply chain management; Block-chain; Event Processing; Event sequencing; High-dimensional; High-dimensional multi-objective differential evolution; Higher-dimensional; Multi-objective differential evolutions; NSGA-III-WA algorithm; Performance; WA-algorithm; Blockchain","","","","Figueroa-Lorenzo, Santiago, Alarm Collector in Smart Train Based on Ethereum Blockchain Events-Log, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 17, pp. 13306-13315, (2021); Qu, Qikai, Road traffic bottleneck analysis for expressway for safety under disaster events using blockchain machine learning, Safety Science, 118, pp. 925-932, (2019); Szabó, Ildikó Borbásné, Affordances in blockchain-based financial recommendations concerned with life events and personalities, Enterprise Information Systems, 16, 12, (2022); Computer Journal, (2023); Su, Yue, A Comparison of Blockchain Recovery Time in Static and Mobile IoT-Blockchain Networks, Future Internet, 14, 11, (2022); Yang, Yaotsung, Blockchain-Based Traffic Event Validation and Trust Verification for VANETs, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 30868-30877, (2019); Zhang, Jinxin, Blockchain use in iot for privacy-preserving anti-pandemic home quarantine, Electronics (Switzerland), 9, 10, pp. 1-16, (2020); Amir Latif, Rana Muhammad, Retail level Blockchain transformation for product supply chain using truffle development platform, Cluster Computing, 24, 1, (2021); Li, Xudong, A blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication system for ensuring multimedia content integrity, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 37, 5, pp. 3050-3071, (2022); Tomar, Ravi K., Maintaining trust in VANETs using blockchain, Ada User Journal, 40, 4, pp. 236-241, (2019)","","Sciendo","","","","","","24448656","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188950046"

Recent rescue cases have shown that the layout of material bases and the allocation of emergency materials need to be further optimized. For this problem, this paper adopts the material hierarchical reserve mode for the first time, combining the material hierarchical reserve mode, multi-level material bases selection model, and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method to determine the optimal location of the coal mine material bases in Liaoning Province. Determine the reserve level of emergency materials through evaluation and clustering analysis of various emergency materials. Improve the traditional gravity model and construct a multi-objective planning model for multi-level material bases site selection. Apply the reserve level of emergency materials and real regional data to the site selection model, and use the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) to solve the model. Then, the optimal site selection scheme was selected using FAHP, and sensitivity analysis was conducted. The research results indicate that: 1) 9 county-level, 6 city-level and 2 provincial-level material bases will be constructed; 2) location selection of material bases is not only affected by costs, but also by the density of road networks; 3) use of hierarchical material reserve mode can significantly reduce the construction cost of material bases. Compared to the traditional material reserve mode, it can reduce costs by 86.6%. Compared to a single-level material bases, it can still reduce costs by 74.7%. The research results of this paper can be used for the selection of emergency material bases and the allocation of emergency material reserves, which can reduce costs and promote the improvement of regional emergency rescue capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","coal mine; decision-making; Emergency material; FAHP; genetic algorithm; site selection","Accident prevention; Coal; Coal industry; Coal mines; Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Cost reduction; Genetic algorithms; Mining; Occupational risks; Proven reserves; Sensitivity analysis; Site selection; Coal-mining; Decisions makings; Emergency material; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Material basis; Multilevels; Occupational safety; Reduce costs; Decision making","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41702347, and in part by Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program under Grant XLYC2008021.","Wu, Bing, Multidimensional Analysis of Coal Mine Safety Accidents in China – 70 Years Review, Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, 40, 1, pp. 253-262, (2023); Liu, Qing, An empirical study of early warning model on the number of coal mine accidents in China, Safety Science, 123, (2020); Energy Sources Part A Recovery Utilization and Environmental Effects, (2020); Li, Xiao, Modified Stochastic Petri Net-Based Modeling and Optimization of Emergency Rescue Processes during Coal Mine Accidents, Geofluids, 2021, (2021); 2022 Emergency Management Results, (2022); Li, Xiao, Evaluation model of coal mine emergency rescue resource allocation based on weight optimization TOPSIS method, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 651, 3, (2021); Operations Research and Management Science, (2014); J Wuhan Univ Technol Social Sci Ed, (2022); Chinese Journal of Management Science, (2017); Yinnan, He, Spatial and temporal convergence of provincial coal mine safety accidents and production and their influencing factors: Data from 23 coal-producing provinces in China (2005–2021), Resources Policy, 86, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187364768"

To meet the high-power demands and mitigate degradation, EVs are equipped with larger-sized battery energy storage systems (ESS) results in increasing their cost and reducing their overall efficiency. Battery and supercapacitor (SC) powered hybrid ESS (HESS), offers an appealing solution to overcome the limitations of standalone battery ESS (BESS). Real-time power sharing among the sources in HESS to achieve satisfactory mileage and battery cycle life is a significant challenge when optimizing power management and dimensioning of HESS. However, to overcome these problems, an integrated optimization approach is proposed using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and fuzzy logic-based control (FLC) strategy. In the process of deriving the optimal configuration for HESS, the battery capacity is identified based on the required minimum range. Moreover, the optimal arrangement of the SC module is derived by minimizing battery capacity loss, HESS mass, and overall financial cost over vehicle lifetime. In comparison to a high-power (HP) standalone BESS, the optimized HESS governed by the proposed energy management (EM) technique can prolong the battery's cycle life by 72.8% and 76.38%, as well as remarkable reductions in ESS life cycle cost-to-range ratio of up to 37.5% and 42.14% when following the standard US06 and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) routes, respectively. Involvement of SC resulted in a substantial 34.3% reduction in the mass of the HESS when compared to the HP standalone BESS. This study further demonstrates that an appropriately tuned fuzzy-logic EM method, which can be seamlessly integrated into a vehicle in real-time, exhibits superior performance in comparison to the basic rule-based approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Battery degradation; dimensioning of HESS; electric vehicles; fuzzy logic control; hybrid energy storage system; optimal sizing","Acceleration; Battery management systems; Computer circuits; Cost reduction; Dynamometers; Energy management systems; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid vehicles; Interactive computer systems; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Real time systems; Secondary batteries; Storage management; Supercapacitor; Battery; Battery degradation; Battery energy storage systems; Dimensioning of hybrid ESS; Fuzzy logic control; High power; Hybrid energy storage systems; Optimal sizing; Optimisations; Real - Time system; Genetic algorithms","","","Thisworkwas supported by PrimeMinister's Research Fellows (PMRF) scheme, administered by theMinistry of Education, Government of India.

It involves determining the optimal execution sequences for a set of jobs on various machines to maximize production efficiency and meet multiple objectives. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) is an effective approach for solving the multi-objective job shop scheduling problem. Nevertheless, it has some limitations in solving scheduling problems, including inadequate global search capability, susceptibility to premature convergence, and challenges in balancing convergence and diversity. To enhance its performance, this paper introduces a strengthened dominance relation NSGA-III algorithm based on differential evolution (NSGA-III-SD). By incorporating constrained differential evolution and simulated binary crossover genetic operators, this algorithm effectively improves NSGA-III’s global search capability while mitigating premature convergence issues. Furthermore, it introduces a reinforced dominance relation to address the tradeoff between convergence and diversity in NSGA-III. Additionally, effective encoding and decoding methods for discrete job shop scheduling are proposed, which can improve the overall performance of the algorithm without complex computation.

Instead of leveraging solid waste's potential to produce energy using waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies, different countries especially developing countries stick to their ineffective and inferior methods to dispose of solid wastes. To fill this gap between energy production and waste management, this paper develops a novel methodology that integrates three efficacious tools, including Monte Carlo simulation, multi-attribute decision-making, and mathematical optimisation modelling to solve the problem from the perspective of economy, energy recovery, environment (3E), and social sustainability. In this paper, a multi-attribute decision-making method, namely AHP, is investigated to select the most suitable emerging WTE technological options as well as the optimal waste collection routes, to capture solid waste as a potential renewable energy source. Monte Carlo simulation and beta-PERT distribution are also applied to reduce the uncertainty intrinsic to decision-making. After validating the proposed methodology in a real-world case study of Tehran city, we apply a novel meta-heuristic algorithm namely NSGA-III to solve the problem on large scales with a reasonable computational time. The performance of this algorithm in solving waste location-routing problems is explored by conducting several trials. Highlights Addressing an integrated waste-to-energy and transportation network for solid waste management.

Existing popularity-prediction-based content caching policies improve QoS and QoE by precaching contents at the network edge, but jointly optimizing multiple network metrics remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a many-objective optimization-based popularity prediction for cooperative caching (MaOPPC-Caching) framework for cloud-edge-end collaborative IoT networks. This framework simultaneously optimizes prediction accuracy, delay, offloaded traffic, and load balance. We integrate three prediction algorithms to forecast content popularity and present a horizontal and vertical collaborative caching decision strategy to generate caching forms based on the predicted results. Then, the many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA) is employed to optimize the combined proportions to take full advantage of hidden preferences and popularity characteristics of both users and items. To promote the convergence of the framework, we present a knowledge mining-based MaOEA (KMaOEA) to incorporate knowledge mining into the optimization process. Simulation results show that the proposed MaOPPC-Caching framework outperforms existing prediction algorithms in terms of four evaluation indicators. Furthermore, KMaOEA shows a significant advantage over NSGA-III in load balance, as indicated by a Mann-Whitney rank sum test with a p-value of 0.040. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud-edge-end collaboration; cooperative caching; Internet of Things (IoT) networks; many-objective optimization; popularity prediction","Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Quality of service; Cloud-computing; Cloud-edge-end collaboration; Collaboration; Cooperative caching; Delay; Internet of thing network; Many-objective optimizations; Optimisations; Popularity predictions; Predictive models; Quality of experience; Internet of things","","","This work was supported in part by the Open Project Program of Joint Innovation Laboratory of Digital GuangXi Smart Infrastructures under Grant GXDIOP2023005; in part by the Beijing Nova Program of Science and Technology under Grant Z191100001119094; in part by the Urban Carbon Neutral Science and Technology Innovation Fund Project of Beijing University of Technology under Grant 040000514122607; in part by the Special Research Program of Academic Cooperation Between Taipei University of Technology and Beijing University of Technology under Grant NTUT-BJUT-112-02; in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant L202016 and Grant 4222002; and in part by the National Taipei University of Technology-Beijing University of Technology Joint Research Program under Grant NTUT-BJUT-112-02","Cisco Visual Networking Index Forecast and Trends 2017 2022, (2019); Fang, Chao, Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Content Distribution in Fog Radio Access Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 9, 18, pp. 16874-16883, (2022); Fang, Chao, Data-driven intelligent future network: Architecture, use cases, and challenges, IEEE Communications Magazine, 57, 7, pp. 34-40, (2019); Gai, Keke, Blockchain-Enabled Service Optimizations in Supply Chain Digital Twin, IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, 16, 3, pp. 1673-1685, (2023); Yan, Qiao, Software-defined networking (SDN) and distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks in cloud computing environments: A survey, some research issues, and challenges, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 18, 1, pp. 602-622, (2016); Zhang, Yue, Blockchain-Empowered Efficient Data Sharing in Internet of Things Settings, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 40, 12, pp. 3422-3436, (2022); Gai, Keke, Blockchain Meets Cloud Computing: A Survey, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 22, 3, pp. 2009-2030, (2020); Deng, Shuiguang, Edge Intelligence: The Confluence of Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 8, pp. 7457-7469, (2020); Tian, Aleteng, Efficient Federated DRL-Based Cooperative Caching for Mobile Edge Networks, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 20, 1, pp. 246-260, (2023); Kai, Caihong, Collaborative Cloud-Edge-End Task Offloading in Mobile-Edge Computing Networks with Limited Communication Capability, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 7, 2, pp. 624-634, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23274662","9781728176055","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163727075"

The congestion caused by increasing freight traffic seriously disrupts urban traffic and leads to environmental issues such as increased carbon emissions. To address this issue, this study proposes a multiobjective optimization approach for the route selection of freight traffic flow within the PCDN, considering the balance among efficiency, environmental performance, and disruption to urban traffic. First, the generation mechanism and characteristics of freight traffic flow in the PCDN are analyzed, followed by the development of a mathematical model based on the static traffic flow distribution theory and the multiobjective optimization theory. Then, a solution framework with NSGA-III as the core is developed, and an improved Dial algorithm is utilized to allocate traffic flow. Finally, taking a large-scale container port as the case study, the solution framework is implemented to address the multiobjective optimization model and obtain the optimal route for freight traffic. The results show that there are significant negative correlations between distributing efficiency and disruption to urban traffic, as well as between distributing efficiency and carbon emissions. Decision-makers can choose the optimal route according to different preferences or adopt the compromise solution by referencing the Pareto front obtained by the solution framework.

In this paper, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III based on utopian point improvement (NSGAIII-UP) is proposed, which overcomes the disadvantage that multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on utopian point decomposition (MOEA/D-UP) cannot handle the multi-segment discontinuous Pareto front (PF) problem well. By comparing the proposed NSGAIII-UP with 8 advanced algorithms by 2 metrics on 22 benchmark functions, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in dealing with the complex PF problems is proved. Moreover, a multivariable model predictive controller (MMPC) is used to control the dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in WWTP, in which NSGAIII-UP is applied to the upper EC optimization of WWTP. The simulation results show that compared with the closed-loop control, the EC in the WWTP is reduced by 7.395 %, and the lowest EC is achieved compared with the other 8 algorithms.

However, alliance members may choose to withdraw from an alliance due to changes in market positioning strategies and short-term profit considerations. Such withdraws often lead to the disintegration of the alliance and result in financial losses for the remaining non-defaulting members. This study focuses on addressing the issues of compensation and profit allocation in a specific scenario known as the collaborative multicenter vehicle routing problem with time windows and defaulting members withdrawal (CMVRPTWDMW). The objective is to ensure alliance stability and fair profit distribution among its members. To achieve this, a tri-objective mathematical model is proposed to optimize the re-formed alliances by considering the total operating cost, number of vehicles, and service waiting time. Additionally, an improved minimum cost remaining saving method is introduced to accurately quantify the deserved profits of non-defaulting members. Compensation quantification and default cost allocation models are then developed based on this analysis. To solve the CMVRPTWDMW and obtain Pareto optimal solutions, a hybrid heuristic algorithm is designed. This algorithm combines a 3D k-means clustering algorithm for customer reassignment after the withdrawal of defaulting members, effectively reducing the complexity of the problem. Furthermore, the algorithm employs a Clarke-Wright saving method-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (CW-NSGA-III) to search for optimal solutions. To enhance the algorithm's search ability, an elite alteration strategy and a penalty-based boundary intersection approach are incorporated into CW-NSGA-III. Finally, a real-world case study conducted in Chongqing City, China, is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed models and solution algorithms. The study contributes valuable insights into the sustainable operation of urban logistics networks that may experience unpredictable defaults, providing guidance for the stability of logistics alliances in the transportation sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative multicenter vehicle routing problems with time windows; Compensation mechanism; NSGA-III; Pareto optimal solution; Profit allocation","Cost benefit analysis; Disintegration; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Losses; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Clarke-Wright savings methods; Collaborative multicenter vehicle routing problem with time window; Compensation mechanism; Logistics network; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-III; Pareto optimal solutions; Profit allocation; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Win-win; Profitability","","","This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71871035), Major Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJZD-M202300704), Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing in 2022 (CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0535, CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0394), Chongqing Bayu Scholar Youth Project (YS2021058).","Adenso-Diaz, Belarmino, Assessing supply chain robustness to links failure, International Journal of Production Research, 56, 15, pp. 5104-5117, (2018); Adenso-Diaz, Belarmino, Assessing partnership savings in horizontal cooperation by planning linked deliveries, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 66, 1, pp. 268-279, (2014); Algaba, E., Horizontal cooperation in a multimodal public transport system: The profit allocation problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 275, 2, pp. 659-665, (2019); Alikar, Najmeh, Application of the NSGA-II algorithm to a multi-period inventory-redundancy allocation problem in a series-parallel system, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 160, pp. 1-10, (2017); Allahyari, Somayeh, A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for the multi-depot covering tour vehicle routing problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 242, 3, pp. 756-768, (2015); Audy, Jean François, An empirical study on coalition formation and cost/savings allocation, International Journal of Production Economics, 136, 1, pp. 13-27, (2012); Azadeh, Ali H., The close–open mixed multi depot vehicle routing problem considering internal and external fleet of vehicles, Transportation Letters, 11, 2, pp. 78-92, (2019); Basso, Franco, A survey on obstacles and difficulties of practical implementation of horizontal collaboration in logistics, International Transactions in Operational Research, 26, 3, pp. 775-793, (2019); Belgin, Önder, Two-echelon vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery: Mathematical model and heuristic approach, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 115, pp. 1-16, (2018); Brandão, José C.S., A memory-based iterated local search algorithm for the multi-depot open vehicle routing problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 284, 2, pp. 559-571, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166469297"

However, typically, research considers only the economics of such efforts. Based on our power flow analysis of the power grid and the correlation properties of carbon emission flow, an optimal power flow calculation model targeting the total carbon emission rate of the power system’s power generation cost, active network loss, and load and network loss was constructed. Next, the NSGA-III algorithm was used to solve the model, and the decision was to coordinate and optimize the output schemes of various types of power plants, such as wind, water, and thermal. The modified IEEE39 node simulation system was built with Matlab software (MATLAB R2020b). The results of the calculation showed that, compared to the traditional method of determining the optimal power flow, the proposed method reduced the system carbon emissions by 20% while the power generation cost increased by less than 2%, which proves the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbon emission flow; NSGA-III algorithm; optimal power flow; TOPSIS method","algorithm; carbon emission; energy flow; numerical model; power generation; software; China","","","","Gazette of the State Council of the People S Republic of China, (2020); Kang, Chongqing Qing, Key Scientific Problems and Research Framework for Carbon Perspective Research of New Power Systems, Dianwang Jishu/Power System Technology, 46, 3, pp. 821-833, (2022); Mei, Tianhua, Low-carbon power dispatching and benefit allocation considering carbon emission allowance, Dianli Xitong Zidonghua/Automation of Electric Power Systems, 40, 22, pp. 49-55, (2016); Compr Util Resour China, (2022); Guo, Xusheng, Low-carbon Operation of Combined Heat and Power Integrated Plants Based on Solar-assisted Carbon Capture, Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy, 10, 5, pp. 1138-1151, (2022); Electr Appl Ind, (2023); Xu, Biao, Reactive power optimization of a distribution network with high-penetration of wind and solar renewable energy and electric vehicles, Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems, 7, 1, (2022); Zhang, Yunning, An Optimal Combining Attack Strategy Against Economic Dispatch of Integrated Energy System, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, 70, 1, pp. 246-250, (2023); Li, Keqiang, Distributed Algorithm of Real-time Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Network with Distributed Energy Resource, Dianli Xitong Zidonghua/Automation of Electric Power Systems, 44, 20, pp. 54-61, (2020); Zhang, Ningyu, Optimal power flow calculation of power system containing TCPST based on improved MCCIPM, Electric Power Engineering Technology, 40, 5, pp. 144-150, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191394818"

Mobile edge computing enables the offloading of tasks to nearby servers to enhance processing efficiency, which makes ISDs idle, causing resource waste and failing to satisfy the high real-time requirements of tasks. Besides, when tasks with different priorities are processed in the order they are generated, it will be difficult for IoT to guarantee a timely response to high-priority tasks. To address the aforementioned issues, we establish an edge-terminal-local architecture by software-defined networking to centrally manage idle ISD resource (2ISDR). Then the proposed two-step scheduling mechanism with preemptive priority queue ensures the real-time responses to high-priority tasks, and the minimum resource allocation coefficients make offloading effective. Finally, we also propose a modified NSGA-III algorithm named MNSGA-III, which is designed to make decisions about offloading and solve resource allocation for tasks, and we correct infeasible solutions by a two-step correction function to ensure the feasibility of MNSGA-III. Experimental results show that the method can ensure a timely response to high-priority tasks and optimize processing time, energy consumption, and economic cost through the utilization of 2ISDR. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","5G mobile communication; computer networks; genetic algorithms; Internet of Things","5G mobile communication systems; Computation offloading; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Mobile edge computing; Resource allocation; 5g mobile communication; Mobile communications; Multi-layers; Priority tasks; Resource allocation schemes; Resources allocation; Scheduling/allocation; Smart devices; Task priorities; Tasks scheduling; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Award (61761007), Guangxi Key Research and Development Plan Project (AB23026037), 2020 Nanning Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leading Talents “YongJiang Plan” Project (2020006).","Naveen, Soumyalatha, Key Technologies and challenges in IoT Edge Computing, pp. 61-65, (2019); Wang, Haoxin, Architectural Design Alternatives Based on Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing for Connected Vehicles, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 22, 4, pp. 2349-2377, (2020); Montazerolghaem, Ahmadreza, Demand Response Application as a Service: An SDN-Based Management Framework, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 13, 3, pp. 1952-1966, (2022); Mahmud, Redowan, Context-Aware Placement of Industry 4.0 Applications in Fog Computing Environments, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 16, 11, pp. 7004-7013, (2020); Alharbi, Hatem A., Energy-Efficient Edge-Fog-Cloud Architecture for IoT-Based Smart Agriculture Environment, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 110480-110492, (2021); Shao, Sujie, Multi task dynamic edge–end computing collaboration for urban Internet of Vehicles, Computer Networks, 227, (2023); Gao, Zhen, Fast Adaptive Task Offloading and Resource Allocation via Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Heterogeneous Vehicular Fog Computing, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 10, 8, pp. 6818-6835, (2023); Abbasi, Mahdi, Intelligent workload allocation in IoT–Fog–cloud architecture towards mobile edge computing, Computer Communications, 169, pp. 71-80, (2021); Vetriveeran, Divya, Docker-Based Intelligent Fall Detection Using Edge-Fog Cloud Infrastructure, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 10, pp. 8133-8144, (2021); Qu, Xiaofeng, Emergency task offloading strategy based on cloud-edge-end collaboration for smart factories, Computer Networks, 234, (2023)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","17518636; 17518628","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178437517"

In pursuit of a resilient water management framework, supportive of local economic growth and social stability, it is prudent for watershed management authorities to sequentially address the intricacies. The foremost step involves resolving supply–demand conflicts stemming from the seasonal ebb and flow before embarking on the development of an optimal dynamic allocation strategy. Therefore, this study has crafted a dynamic, seasonally responsive, multi-objective, multi-period water allocation system that harmonizes three pivotal objectives: economic efficiency, equity, and utilization efficiency. Then, to effectively mitigate the economic risks associated with uncertainty, the dynamic allocation framework incorporates the VaR and accounts for uncertainties in available surface water resources. Employing the improved adaptive self-constrained NSGA-III algorithm, we endeavored to simulate the optimal equilibrium solution in the face of various risks and facilitate a tradeoff between these objectives through a multi-period interaction mechanism. This iterative process displayed convergence within the range of 1.75 × 104 and 2.45 × 104 iterations. The proposed model was implemented to address the pressing issue of unsustainable water allocation within the MRB system in western China. Its validity and practicability were confirmed, and water allocation strategies were simulated across three distinct risk scenarios: high, medium, and low. Significantly, these findings have highlighted Chengdu as the focal area for considerable water apportionment. In light of this revelation, an emergency cooperation system has been established to address water shortages and uncertainties. Furthermore, some policy recommendations designed to guide watershed managers in the effective allocation of water resources. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic multi-period planning; Economic benefits; Equity; Improved NSGA-III; Water allocation","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economic efficiency; Risk perception; Soil conservation; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Allocation strategy; Dynamic allocations; Dynamic multi-period planning; Economic benefits; Equity; Improved NSGA-III; Multi-period; Uncertainty; Water allocations; Watersheds management; Iterative methods","","","We sincerely thank the editors and reviewers for their help.

Specifically, a series of sophisticated selection strategies have been adopted, some of which need additional pre-defined parameters or a significant amount of extra computation time, which retards their applications in real life. In this paper, we propose an efficient indicator-based MaOEA with few parameters, SDE+-MOEA, that uses an adaptive combination of commonly used selection methods to improve search efficiency based on SDE+. SDE+ addresses situations where SDE cannot distinguish individuals with the same SDE values. The adaptive selection method dynamically selects between one-time and iterative selection methods at different stages of evolution to improve the search efficiency. Furthermore, apart from the four parameters for generating offspring, our proposed SDE+-MOEA does not introduce additional parameters. We conduct experimental studies to compare SDE+-MOEA with 11 state-of-the-art algorithms, including 2REA, I<inf>SDE+</inf>, θ-DEA, LMPFE, CVEA3, SRA, MOEA/DD, IBEA, Two_Arch2, NSGA-III, and SPEA2SDE using four representative performance indicators (HV, SP, PD and GD) on MaF benchmark with 5, 8, 10, and 15 objectives. Experimental studies demonstrate that, compared to the algorithms, SDE+-MOEA achieves better HV and competitive convergence and uniformity performance, while requiring few parameters. It means that SDE+-MOEA can find a solution set with better convergence and uniformity to help decision-makers understand the solved problems. Furthermore, SDE+-MOEA loses little spreadability since a better convergence often leads to a worse spread. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Indicator-based selection; Many-objective evolutionary algorithm; Many-objective optimization; Multi-criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization","Benchmarking; Decision making; Efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Iterative methods; Parameter estimation; Indicator-based selection; Many-objective evolutionary algorithm; Many-objective optimizations; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Optimization algorithms; Search efficiency; Selection methods; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2023YFE0106300 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62250710682 ), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant No. 2021A1515011830 ), the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory (Grant No. 2020B121201001 ), the Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams (Grant No. 2017ZT07X386 ), the Shenzhen Fundamental Research Programs (Grant No. 20220815181327001 ), and the Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (RITAS) .","Zhang, Qingquan, Mitigating Unfairness via Evolutionary Multiobjective Ensemble Learning, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 27, 4, pp. 848-862, (2023); Liu, Jialin, fSDE: efficient evolutionary optimisation for many-objective aero-engine calibration, Complex and Intelligent Systems, 8, 4, pp. 2731-2747, (2022); Afşar, Sezin, Multi-objective enhanced memetic algorithm for green job shop scheduling with uncertain times, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 68, (2022); Liu, Cong, Multiobjective multiple features fusion: A case study in image segmentation, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 60, (2021); Kumar, Abhishek, A Benchmark-Suite of real-World constrained multi-objective optimization problems and some baseline results, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 67, (2021); Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Li, Miqing, Quality evaluation of solution sets in multiobjective optimisation: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 52, 2, (2020); Khare, Vineet R., Performance scaling of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2632, pp. 376-390, (2003); Ishibuchi, Hisao, Evolutionary many-objective optimization: A short review, pp. 2419-2426, (2008); Yu, Guo, A Survey on Knee-Oriented Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 26, 6, pp. 1452-1472, (2022)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174729594"

In the IaaS cloud, the virtual machine (VM) is the execution unit that processes the user workloads. Virtualization enables the execution of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine (PM). Virtual machine placement (VMP) strategically assigns VMs to suitable physical devices within a data center. From the cloud provider's perspective, the virtual machine must be placed optimally to reduce resource wastage to aid economic revenue and develop green data centres. Cloud providers need an efficient methodology to minimize resource wastage, power consumption, and network transmission delay. This paper uses NSGA-III, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to simultaneously reduce the mentioned objectives to obtain a non-dominated solution. The performance metrics (Overall Nondominated Vector Generation and Spacing) of the proposed NSGA-III algorithm is compared with other multi-objective algorithms, namely VEGA, MOGA, SPEA, and NSGA-II. It is observed that the proposed algorithm performs 7% better that the existing algorithm in terms of ONVG and 12% better results in terms of spacing.

To design an alternative framework and provide a promising solution, this article proposes a novel co-optimization methodology that incorporates the high-fidelity model (HFM) of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The present methodology employs the maps of engines and electric motors during the optimization process. In addition, based on the Pareto optimization method, an adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) with chaos sequence (NSGA-CS) is proposed. By setting an objective function that concerns the fuel consumption, battery state of health (SOH), and manufacturing cost, the co-optimization effect of NSGA-CS with HFM (NSGA-CS & HFM) is compared with that of NSGA-III with Willans model (NSGA-CS & WM) using the real-Time control strategy. Under the NEDC-WLTC driving cycle, compared with the original vehicle, the NSGA-CS & HFM approach can reduce fuel consumption, battery SOH loss, and system costs by 7.4%, 8.0%, and 6.3%, respectively. The effectiveness of the optimized parameters is verified in the hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment. These results suggest that the novel co-optimization methodology proposed in this article is effective in optimizing the powertrain parameters and control strategies and can further promote the energy-saving potential of HEV/PHEVs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","component sizing; energy management; High-fidelity models; hybrid powertrains; pareto-based optimization","Energy conservation; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Powertrains; Real time control; Secondary batteries; Vehicle transmissions; Battery; Chaos sequence; Component sizing; Computational modelling; High-fidelity modeling; Mechanical power transmission; Optimisations; Pareto-based optimization; Vehicle's dynamics; Energy management","","","","Paul, Subhodeep, Review on the development scenario of renewable energy in different country, (2021); Marra, Dario, Vehicle electrification: A further variable toward integrated intelligent energy systems, (2017); Zhang, Hao, Leveraging the benefits of ethanol-fueled advanced combustion and supervisory control optimization in hybrid biofuel-electric vehicles, Applied Energy, 326, (2022); Huang, Yanjun, Model predictive control power management strategies for HEVs: A review, Journal of Power Sources, 341, pp. 91-106, (2017); Li, Yuecheng, Deep reinforcement learning-based energy management for a series hybrid electric vehicle enabled by history cumulative trip information, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 68, 8, pp. 7416-7430, (2019); Wang, Hong, Cyber-Physical Predictive Energy Management for Through-the-Road Hybrid Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 68, 4, pp. 3246-3256, (2019); Wang, Hong, Model predictive control-based energy management strategy for a series hybrid electric tracked vehicle, Applied Energy, 182, pp. 105-114, (2016); Li, Yapeng, Real-Time Multiobjective Energy Management for Electrified Powertrains: A Convex Optimization-Driven Predictive Approach, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 8, 3, pp. 3139-3150, (2022); Hu, Xiaosong, Optimal Energy Management and Sizing of a Dual Motor-Driven Electric Powertrain, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 34, 8, pp. 7489-7501, (2019); Hu, Xiaosong, Integrated Optimization of Battery Sizing, Charging, and Power Management in Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 24, 3, pp. 1036-1043, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","00189545; 19399359","","ITVTA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165300527"

In 2020 and 2021, Internet usage grew by 50% in several European countries, mainly due to home office, video streaming, hybrid teaching, and others. High-capacity optical networks usually meet this growing demand for Internet services. Thus, investigations that can improve the quality of optical networks are highly relevant in the current context. One of the research problems in this area is related to the physical topology design (PTD) of optical networks, which is classified as NP-hard. Several studies on PTD consider the application of meta-heuristics that obtain suboptimal solutions in a time compatible with engineering applications. However, meta-heuristics and local search techniques have been combined in several other optimization problems, which is not typical for the PTD problem. This paper proposes a solution to the PTD problem that combines a known multipurpose optimization algorithm, the NSGA-III, with operators considering the domain-specific knowledge of the problem to provide superior-quality networks.

Although it has a significant advantage in exploring potential Pareto-optimal solutions, it has rarely been applied in many-objective problems due to its high computational cost. To address this issue, this article proposes an expensive many-objective optimization algorithm based on the framework of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and assisted by the kriging surrogate models. In the proposed algorithm, the Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) method for EHVI estimation is improved by importance sampling, in which only one sampling process is required during the entire optimization process using a uniform distribution in normalized objective space. Considering the predicted uncertainty from the kriging model, an uncertainty-assisted nondominated sorting approach is proposed to substitute for the conventional approach in NSGA-III. In the proposed method, the predicted uncertainty is incorporated into the objective space as one independent dimension for nondominated sorting, which can enable the exploration of potential points with desirable EHVI values. In addition, the proposed algorithm considers the diversity of the solutions by de-emphasizing the pursuit of the best EHVI.

With increasing awareness of sustainable practices in the manufacturing environment, this study addresses a sustainable SSALBP, where a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for the first time for this type of assembly systems. The model consists of three objectives and each of the objectives represents the three pillars of sustainability. The problem becomes more realistic by considering uncertainty in processing time and the influence of human workers’ age and skill in processing time. The uncertainty is adopted in the MILP model by using a chance-constraint programing approach. Since the problem is complex, Q-learning and Monte-Carlo simulation-assisted based genetic algorithm (GA) based memetic algorithm (MA) are proposed to solve the problem. The performance of MA is evaluated against the well-known non-dominated sorting GA-III (NSGA-III) and state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the problem. The experimental results show that MA surpasses its contest significantly in finding better Pareto-fronts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chance constraint programming; Cycle time; Energy; Ergonomic risks; Memetic algorithm; Semi-automated assembly line","Assembly; Assembly machines; Constraint programming; Ergonomics; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Robot programming; Sustainable development; Assembly line balancing problems; Automated assembly lines; Chance constraint programming; Cycle time; Energy; Ergonomic risk; Memetic algorithms; Mixed integer linear programming model; Semi-automated assembly line; Workers'; Genetic algorithms","","","","undefined, (2022); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2016); Berti, Nicola, Ageing workforce effects in Dual-Resource Constrained job-shop scheduling, International Journal of Production Economics, 237, (2021); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2021); Balancing of A Continuous Production Line, (1954); Campana, Nícolas P., Mathematical models and heuristic methods for the assembly line balancing problem with hierarchical worker assignment, International Journal of Production Research, 60, 7, pp. 2193-2211, (2022); Chen, James C., Multi-project scheduling with multi-skilled workforce assignment considering uncertainty and learning effect for large-scale equipment manufacturer, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 169, (2022); Chen, Ronghua, A self-learning genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning for flexible job-shop scheduling problem, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 149, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162084798"

The use of machine learning techniques to enhance optimization algorithms applied to MaOPs has been drawing attention due to their ability to add domain knowledge during the search process. One method of this kind is inverse modeling, which uses machine learning models to enhance MOEAs differently, mapping the objective function values to the decision variables. The Decision Variable Learning (DVL) algorithm uses the inverse model in its concept and has shown good performance due to the ability to directly predict solutions closed to the Pareto-optimal front. The main goal of this work is to experimentally show the DVL as an optimization algorithm for MaOPs.

This paper presents a passenger-centric approach for multimodal timetable optimization. We suggest a many-objective mixed programming model that takes the travel mode choice into account. By simulating the utility function of passengers’ perceived travel cost, scheduling measures are developed that also take the time window, capacity, and overtaking into account. Afterwards, by minimizing the number of related solutions, we present a Fast Hypervolume indicator-based Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (FH-MOEA), which can swiftly determine the hypervolume contribution of each solution. Furthermore, by merging FH-MOEA with Reference Point Based Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms (R-NSGA-III), we propose the hybrid algorithm FHR-NSGA-III for finding high-quality solutions.

However, the large increase in feature dimensions poses a great challenge to FS methods. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization algorithm consisting of an Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) and NSGA-III was proposed to solve the FS problem with high-dimensional data. Through S-shaped, V-shaped and U-shaped transfer functions, the conversion from real number coding to binary coding is realized to solve discrete problems, and the influence of these three transfer functions on the effect of FS is compared. In addition, the algorithm optimizes the population in the binary search space by building an external archive, and realizes the selection and optimization of external archive individuals based on the clustering strategy. The KNN classifier was used to realize the classification progress. The simulation experiments are divided into two groups with 18 medium and high dimensional data. The first group analyzes the optimization effect of the proposed framework under three transfer functions. The second group of experiments selects the algorithm that wins in the first group of experiments and compares it with eleven classical multi-objective optimization algorithms. The evaluation criteria includes two optimization objectives of the FS problem and the optimization indices of HV and IGD. The first set of experiments showed that the U-shaped transfer function family performed best in the FS problem, with U3 being the most excellent, followed by V-shaped and S-shaped. Compared to other multi-objective optimization algorithms, the simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clustering guidance; Equilibrium optimizer; Feature selection; NSGA-III; Transfer function","Clustering algorithms; Feature Selection; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Clustering guidance; Clusterings; Equilibrium optimizer; Feature selection problem; Features selection; High dimensional data; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-III; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Transfer functions","","","This work was supported by the Basic Scientific Research Project of Institution of Higher Learning of Liaoning Province (Grant No. LJKZ0293), and the Postgraduate Education Reform Project of Liaoning Province (Grant No. LNYJG2022137).","undefined, (2014); Amaldi, Edoardo, On the approximability of minimizing nonzero variables or unsatisfied relations in linear systems, Theoretical Computer Science, 209, 1-2, pp. 237-260, (1998); Altarabichi, Mohammed Ghaith, Fast Genetic Algorithm for feature selection — A qualitative approximation approach[Formula presented], Expert Systems with Applications, 211, (2023); Mafarja, Majdi M., An Efficient High-dimensional Feature Selection Approach Driven By Enhanced Multi-strategy Grey Wolf Optimizer for Biological Data Classification, Neural Computing and Applications, 35, 2, pp. 1749-1775, (2023); Sun, Lin, TSFNFS: two-stage-fuzzy-neighborhood feature selection with binary whale optimization algorithm, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 14, 2, pp. 609-631, (2023); Wazery, Yaser Maher, An Efficient Slime Mould Algorithm Combined with K-Nearest Neighbor for Medical Classification Tasks, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 113666-113682, (2021); Braik, Malik S., Enhanced Ali Baba and the forty thieves algorithm for feature selection, Neural Computing and Applications, 35, 8, pp. 6153-6184, (2023); Akinola, Olatunji A., Binary dwarf mongoose optimizer for solving high-dimensional feature selection problems, PLOS ONE, 17, 10 October, (2022); Ewees, Ahmed A., Improved seagull optimization algorithm using Lévy flight and mutation operator for feature selection, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 10, pp. 7437-7472, (2022); Hussien, Abdelazim G., A self-adaptive Harris Hawks optimization algorithm with opposition-based learning and chaotic local search strategy for global optimization and feature selection, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 13, 2, pp. 309-336, (2022)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169977807"

In such scenarios, there is not a unique solution to the problem; instead, there is a set of solutions known as the Pareto front, representing the trade-off between objectives. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can approximate these solutions in a single run. However, due to their resource-intensive nature, MOEAs are not suitable for solving real-time and engineering MOPs such as the optimization of manufacturing processes and energy consumption in wireless networks, where a fast convergence rate with less computational cost is required. Fortunately, micro versions of MOEAs can meet this requirement by utilizing a tiny population size. However, this can result in a rapid loss of diversity and the algorithm may easily fall into a local optimum. While some approaches such as the restart technique have been proposed to address this issue, hybrid techniques such as integrative, collaborative, and decomposition-based methods have not been effectively considered in the design of micro algorithms, despite hybridization being a widely accepted method for enhancing the diversity of evolutionary algorithms. In this study, we propose a hybrid micro MOEA called μMOSM that can effectively tackle the diversity loss problem and accelerate the convergence rate in approximating Pareto front solutions. Experimental results on benchmark test suites and a real-world MOP demonstrate the advantages of our proposed algorithm and confirm that μMOSM outperforms state-of-the-art MOEAs and micro MOEAs such as MOSM, ADE-MOIA, MMOPSO, NSGA-III, MOEA/D-FRRMAB, μFAME, and ASMiGA. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid evolutionary algorithm; Micro algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-operator","Benchmarking; Cost engineering; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Multiobjective optimization; Population statistics; Conflicting objectives; Hybrid evolutionary algorithm; Micro algorithm; Multi objective; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Multioperators; Pareto front; Trade off; Evolutionary algorithms","","","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","Abdi, Yousef, On the impact of information-sharing model between subpopulations in the Island-based evolutionary algorithms: search manager framework as a case study, Journal of Supercomputing, 79, 13, pp. 14245-14286, (2023); Abdi, Yousef, Hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on Search Manager framework for big data optimization problems, Applied Soft Computing, 87, (2020); Abdi, Yousef, Search manager: A framework for hybridizing different search strategies, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 9, 5, pp. 525-540, (2018); Alkebsi, Khalil Abdulghani Mutahar, A Fast Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on a New Archive Updating Mechanism, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 124734-124754, (2020); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Cabrera, Juan Carlos Fuentes, Micro-MOPSO: A multi-objective particle Swarm Optimizer that uses a very small population size, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 261, pp. 83-104, (2010); Carrasco, Jacinto, Recent trends in the use of statistical tests for comparing swarm and evolutionary computing algorithms: Practical guidelines and a critical review, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 54, (2020); Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Gecco 2001, (2001); Cavalcante da Silva, Gabriela, Revisiting Pareto-Optimal Multi- and Many-Objective Reference Fronts for Continuous Optimization, pp. 1171-1178, (2021); Complex Systems, (1995)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09521976","","EAAIE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169291277"

The objective of this paper is to find the best values that will represent the system under study as a whole. This problem can be seen as an optimization problem. To find its feasible and optimal solution, this work proposes a new metaheuristics multi-objective based on the Lion Algorithm (LA), called the Multi-Objective Lion Algorithm (MOLA), and its application in the estimation of parameters of the system under study.

An integrated optimization design methodology is proposed by combining intelligent optimization algorithms with generative design. Firstly, the meta-model is established to explore the relationship between design variables, quality, strain energy, and inherent energy. Then, employing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), the optimal frameworks of the structure are sought within the entire design space. Immediately following, a structure is rebuilt based on the principle of cooperative equilibrium. Furthermore, the rebuilt structure is integrated into a generative design, enabling automatic iteration by controlling the initial parameter set. The quality and rigidity of the structure under different reconstructions are evaluated, resulting in solution generation for structural optimization. Finally, the optimal structure obtained is validated. Research outcomes indicate that the quality of structures generated through the comprehensive optimization method is reduced by 27%, and the inherent energy increases by 0.95 times. Moreover, the overall structural deformation is less than 0.003 mm, with a maximum stress of 3.2 MPa—significantly lower than the yield strength and meeting industrial usage standards.

The method integrates design software (SolidWorks 2023), simulation tools (COMSOL Multiphysics), and MATLAB. The optimization phase utilizes the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II and -III to fine-tune the geometry configuration by adjusting six inner parameters corresponding to the dimension of the interior components of the LVDT, thus aiming to improve the overall performance of the device. The outcomes of this study reveal a significant achievement in LVDT enhancement. By employing the proposed methodology, the operational range of the LVDT was effectively doubled, extending it from its initial 8 (mm) to 16 (mm). This expansion in the operational range was achieved without compromising measurement accuracy, as all error values for the working range of 0–16 (mm) (NSGA-II with a maximum final relative error of 2.22% and NSGA-III with 2.44%) remained below the imposed 3% limit. This research introduces a new concept in LVDT optimization, capitalizing on the combined power of NSGA-II and NSGA-III algorithms. The integration of these advanced algorithms, along with the interconnection between design, simulation, and programming tools, distinguishes this work from conventional approaches. This study fulfilled its initial objectives and generated quantifiable results. It introduced novel internal configurations that substantially improved the LVDT’s performance.

Thus, it is more suitable to model an MOOPF as a biparty multiobjective optimal power flow (BPMOOPF) problem. However, so far, there is no work on treating and solving the MOOPF problem from the perspective of biparty multiobjective optimization. In this paper, we propose the definition of the BPMOOPF problem as well as a novel evolutionary biparty multiobjective optimization algorithm for solving the BPMOOPF problem, which we call BPMOOPF-EA. Our experimental results show that, compared two state-of-the-art algorithms (C-MOEA/D and A-NSGA-III), our proposed BPMOOPF-EA has a better performance when solving the BPMOOPF problem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition; Multiobjective optimization; Multiparty multiobjective optimization; Optimal power flow","Acoustic generators; Decision making; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Evolutionary algorithms; Transmissions; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objective optimal power flow; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; Multiparty multiobjective optimization; Optimal power flow problem; Optimal power flows; Problem definition; Multiobjective optimization","","","This study is supported by Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program (Grant No. JCYJ20220818102414030 ), the Major Key Project of PCL (Grant No. PCL2022A03 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (Grant No. ZDSYS20210623091809029 ), Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Novel Security Intelligence Technologies (Grant No. 2022B1212010005 ).

The increasing optimizing objectives as well as complex constraints of power balance and other system limits bring a decrease in selection pressure and challenges of constraint handling techniques for traditional multi-objective evaluation algorithms. Aiming at the solving difficulties of Ma-OPF problems, an improved NSGA-III integrating eliminating strategy and dynamic constraint relaxation mechanism (NSGA-III-EDR) is proposed. In the proposed approach, a new elimination strategy that eliminates the associated points having the largest angle with the corresponding reference line is employed to increase the selection pressure of the algorithm. An integrated constraint handling method, which employs a repair strategy based on assigning decision variables to feasible values and a penalty function approach together to handle power flow equality constraints, is also introduced into the NSGA-III-EDR. Aiming at lacking feasible solutions of the algorithm in the early searching stage, a strategy of relaxing constraint violations as well as a dynamic updating strategy for the tolerated threshold value of distinguishing feasible and infeasible solutions at the early evolution is proposed. Moreover, an improved domination sorting rule based on the proposed constraint handling method and the relaxing strategy to constraint violations is employed to promote the generation of feasible solutions. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed improved NSGA-III-EDR approach are studied and evaluated on different test cases of a famous standard IEEE 30-bus power system as well as the larger power systems of IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus. The numerical results show that the proposed NSGA-III-EDR method can provide solutions to many-objective OPF problems with tremendous potential compared with the traditional NSGA-III and other algorithms illustrated in the literature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic constraint relaxation; Elimination strategy; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Optimal power flow","Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Numerical methods; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Constraint relaxation; Dynamic constraint relaxation; Dynamic constraints; Elimination strategy; Feasible solution; Many-objective optimizations; NSGA-III; Optimal power flow problem; Optimal power flows; Relaxation mechanism; Constraint handling","","","This work is partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62173284 ), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation, China ( 2019A1515010411 ) and Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (File no.

In particular, in order to globally capture the interactions among criteria, Choquet-based relative closeness degrees are developed based on the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the Choquet integral. Then, the q-ROF Choquet-based group consistency index (q-ROFCGCI) and the q-ROF Choquet-based group inconsistency index (q-ROFCGII) are defined. Next, to derive optimal 2-additive fuzzy measures on the criteria set and optimal experts' weights, a new multi-objective q-ROF mathematical programming model is established by minimizing the q-ROFCGII and maximizing the q-ROFCGCI. Subsequently, an algorithm based on the adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (A-NSGA-III) is designed to solve the established model. Afterwards, the Choquet-based overall relative closeness degrees of the alternatives are used to obtain their preferred ordering.

This study seeks to solve MO-OPs through a problem-decomposition framework, that is, an MO-OP is decomposed into a multiobjective knapsack problem (MOKP) and a traveling salesman problem (TSP). The MOKP and TSP are then solved by a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, respectively. While the MOEA module is for selecting cities, the DRL module is for planning a Hamiltonian path for these cities. An iterative use of these two modules drives the population toward the Pareto front of MO-OPs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is compared against NSGA-II and NSGA-III on various types of MO-OP instances. Experimental results show that our method performs best on almost all the test instances and has shown strong generalization ability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decomposition; deep reinforcement learning (DRL); evolutionary algorithms (EAs); multiobjective optimization; orienteering problems (OPs); pointer networks (PNs)","Combinatorial optimization; Deep learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Personnel training; Reinforcement learning; Traveling salesman problem; Urban planning; Computational modelling; Deep reinforcement learning; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Orienteering problem; Pointer network; Reinforcement learnings; Urban areas; Iterative methods","","","This work was supported in part by the National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars under Grant 62122093; in part by the Scientific Key Research Project of National University of Defense Technology under Grant ZZKY-ZX-11-04; and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 72071205.","Wang, Zheng, Vehicle routing problem with drones, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 122, pp. 350-364, (2019); Dasdemir, Erdi, UAV routing for reconnaissance mission: A multi-objective orienteering problem with time-dependent prizes and multiple connections, Computers and Operations Research, 145, (2022); De Cubber, Geert, UAS deployment and data processing during the Balkans flooding, (2014); Nikolic, Janosch, A UAV system for inspection of industrial facilities, IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, (2013); Golden, Bruce L., The orienteering problem, Naval Research Logistics, 34, 3, pp. 307-318, (1987); Laporte, Gilbert, The selective travelling salesman problem, Discrete Applied Mathematics, 26, 2-3, pp. 193-207, (1990); Ramesh, Ramaswamy, Optimal algorithm for the orienteering tour problem, ORSA journal on computing, 4, 2, pp. 155-164, (1992); Leifer, Adrienne C., Strong linear programming relaxations for the orienteering problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 73, 3, pp. 517-523, (1994); Vansteenwegen, Pieter, The orienteering problem: A survey, European Journal of Operational Research, 209, 1, pp. 1-10, (2011); Gunawan, Aldy, Orienteering Problem: A survey of recent variants, solution approaches and applications, European Journal of Operational Research, 255, 2, pp. 315-332, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136875413"

The design of the RMS aims to achieve sufficient responsiveness so that it can be quickly adopted to the changes required for a niche market of a customized product family. Most components of the RMS are designed to be modular. Reconfigurable machines are one of the main modular components of the RMS. In the design of the RMS, the problem of machine selection is of primary interest, as the modular machines, with their respective tools and configurations, are selected to perform a given part from the part family. Due to this trilogy of machine, tool, and configuration selection, only one type of machine is considered. To remedy this shortcoming, this work introduces a new concept of modular machine configuration capability, which leads to the selection of two types of machines, namely, the single-spindle modular reconfigurable machines (SRMT) and the multi-spindle reconfigurable machines (MRMT). This paper addresses the problem of machine selection and RMS design. Firstly, a bi-objective mathematical model is developed for the generation of the process plan and the selection of reconfigurable machines. The results obtained, together with an initial layout, are then used to generate the RMS design. Secondly, a new objective function is introduced to address the problem of under-utilization of reconfigurable multi-spindle machines.

In this method, the configuration of multi-channel EMAs involves solving a high-dimensional and nonlinear problem containing complex constraints offline. This article develops a general framework for the EMAs multi-objective optimization configuration (MOOC) by combining the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) with the designing of objectives, handling of constraints, consideration of the iterative efficiency and the diversity of solutions. The numerical simulation results confirm the feasibility of the framework for searching the non-inferior configurations and reveal the function mechanism that intermediate variables of the nonlinear optimization model on AMB performance. Finally, the best configurations identified using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) are applied to the 4-DOF AMB experimental platform.

This encourages the search for algorithms better able to find Pareto fronts with more convergence, coverage, and lower computational cost. This work shows the creation and validation of the Multi-objective Sunflower Optimization (MOSFO), a hypercubic and constrained multi-objective meta-heuristic inspired by the phototropic life cycle of sunflowers around the sun. Having a much simpler programming model than most evolutionary algorithms, MOSFO was validated using the most difficult set of test functions in the literature (CEC 2009) and applied to ten constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CEC 2021). The proposed algorithm was compared with ten other powerful algorithms: MOGWO, MOPSO, NSGA-II, MOEA/D, NSGA-III, CCMO, ARMOEA, ToP, TiGE 2, and AnD. Inverted General Distance, Spacing, Maximum Spread, and Hyper volume were used as comparison metrics to evaluate the convergence and coverage capabilities of the algorithms. MOSFO had the best average IGD value in 8 of the 10 test functions when compared with the other algorithms. In terms of MS, MOSFO had the highest average value of MS for 7 of the test functions. In summary, MOSFO showed substantial convergence and coverage capabilities and proved to be very competitive among the algorithms used, which were carefully selected to be popular and recent. The method is even more promising for problems with three or more objectives. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","meta-heuristics; multi-objective optimization; multi-objective sunflower optimization","Constrained optimization; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Life cycle; Decision-making method; Engineering problems; Metaheuristic; Multi objective; Multi-objective sunflower optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Posteriori decision; State of the art; Test-functions; Multiobjective optimization","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support given by the Brazilian agency Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) (grant APQ‐00385‐18), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (307770/2022‐2) and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (grant 2022/10683‐7).","Awad, Mariette, Efficient learning machines: Theories, concepts, and applications for engineers and system designers, pp. 1-248, (2015); Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice, (1996); Baril, Chantal, Design for Six Sigma through collaborative multiobjective optimization, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 60, 1, pp. 43-55, (2011); Branke, Juergen, Guidance in evolutionary multi-objective optimization, Advances in Engineering Software, 32, 6, pp. 499-507, (2001); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007); Coello, Carlos A., Use of a self-adaptive penalty approach for engineering optimization problems, Computers in Industry, 41, 2, pp. 113-127, (2000); Coello, Carlos A., Solving multiobjective optimization problems using an artificial immune system, Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 6, 2, pp. 163-190, (2005); Coello, Carlos A., Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 8, 3, pp. 256-279, (2004); Cohon, Jared L., A review and evaluation of multiobjective programing techniques, Water Resources Research, 11, 2, pp. 208-220, (1975); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","02664720; 14680394","0896710742","EXSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158110136"

In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism called efficient dynamic transaction storage (EDTS) for dynamically allocating transactions among blocks to achieve efficient storage utilization. By leveraging a combination of Cuckoo Filter and dynamic transaction storage (DTS) strategies, EDTS is able to improve the scalability while remaining sustainable even after Bitcoin enters a transaction-fee regime. In addition to preventing deviant mining behaviors under the transaction-fee regime, EDTS can also provide differentiated transmission priorities based on transaction fees while allowing the investors to engage in pledging more transaction fees. In EDTS, we applied the multi-objective optimization algorithm U-NSGA-III to find the best DTS strategy and its corresponding attributes. Experimental results show that the EDTS mechanism together with the optimized DTS strategies can achieve a throughput of 325.3 TPS. EDTS offers scalability improvements comparable to the best Graphene solution and outperforms most of the latest scaling solutions by at least 11.6% while maintaining sustainability under the transaction-fee regime. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Block propagation; Blockchain; Dynamic transaction storage; Scalability; Sustainability; Transaction fee","Blockchain; Dynamics; Multiobjective optimization; Sustainable development; Block propagation; Block-chain; Dynamic transaction storage; High-throughput; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization algorithms; Priority-based; Storage mechanism; Storage utilization; Transaction fee; Scalability","","","This research was funded by University of Macau (File no.

It has powerful computing capabilities and can be well-used to provide low-latency services to execute some computation applications generated by IIoT devices. However, the existing methods may not be directly used for IIoT scenarios due to the large size of IIoT devices and the characteristics of the applications, as well as the limited and heterogeneous resources of edge servers.

Due to the influence of size effects, micro-milling exhibits higher specific energy consumption compared with traditional milling, implying that more energy is consumed to remove a unit volume of material, particularly in challenging-to-machine materials like Ti-6Al-4V. Historically, research on parameter optimization for micro-milling has predominantly focused on enhancing machining quality and efficiency, with limited attention given to energy efficiency. However, in the context of the “double carbon” strategy, energy conservation and emissions reduction have garnered significant attention in the manufacturing industry. Therefore, this paper proposes a micro-milling parameter-based power consumption model. Based on this, a specific energy consumption model can be obtained. Moreover, evolutionary algorithms are utilized for the optimization of micro-milling parameters, which aims to achieve comprehensive enhancements in both machinability and sustainability. The optimization objectives encompass improving surface quality, dimensional accuracy, material removal rate, and specific energy consumption during the micro-milling process for thin-walled micro-structures.

The first strategy updates the individuals of the first nondomination rank by a modified improvisation of the harmony search algorithm, which accelerates the information exchanges of the elite individuals. The second strategy regulates the individuals of the last nondomination rank according to a modified single-point crossover of the genetic algorithm, which strengthens the convergence of the population. The third strategy adjusts the remaining individuals in terms of a modified DE/rand-to-best/1 mutation of the differential evolution algorithm, and it guides these individuals to move towards the ones which have at least one minimum objective function value, which is beneficial for expanding the distribution range of the population. NSGA-III-TCS obtains the largest average hypervolumes and shows a desirable convergence for six CHPDEED problems. NSGA-III-TCS achieves relatively high coverage rates in most cases, indicating the dominance of the Pareto sets of NSGA-III-TCS over those of the other algorithms.

The most commonly used method for solving dynamic problems are dispatching rules (DRs), simple constructive heuristics that build the schedule incrementally. Since it is difficult to design DRs manually, they are often created automatically using genetic programming. Although such rules work well, their performance is still limited and various methods, especially ensemble learning, are used to improve them. So far, ensembles have only been used in the context of single-objective scheduling problems. This study aims to investigate the possibility of constructing ensembles of DRs for solving multi-objective (MO) scheduling problems. To this end, an existing ensemble construction method called SEC is adapted by extending it with non-dominated sorting to construct Pareto fronts of ensembles for a given MO problem. In addition, the algorithms NSGA-II and NSGA-III were adapted to construct ensembles and compared with the SEC method to demonstrate their effectiveness. All methods were evaluated on four MO problems with different number of criteria to be optimised. The results show that ensembles of DRs achieve better Pareto fronts compared to individual DRs. Moreover, the results show that SEC achieves equally good or even slightly better results than NSGA-II and NSGA-III when constructing ensembles, while it is simpler and slightly less computationally expensive. This shows the potential of using ensembles to increase the performance of individual DRs for MO problems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ensemble learning; genetic programming; multi-objective optimisation; Unrelated machines environment","Combinatorial optimization; Dynamics; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Multiobjective optimization; Problem solving; Screening; Dispatching rules; Ensemble learning; Machine environment; Multi-objective problem; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-II; Pareto front; Performance; Unrelated machine environment; Unrelated machines; Genetic programming","","","This work has been supported in part by Croatian Science Foundation under the project IP-2019-04-4333 and by the Spanish Government under research project PID2019-106263RB-I00.","Scheduling, (2012); Hart, Emma, Evolutionary scheduling: A review, Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 6, 2, pp. 191-220, (2005); Ðurasević, Marko, A survey of dispatching rules for the dynamic unrelated machines environment, Expert Systems with Applications, 113, pp. 555-569, (2018); A Field Guide to Genetic Programming, (2008); Gil Gala, Francisco Javier, Genetic Algorithm to Evolve Ensembles of Rules for On-Line Scheduling on Single Machine with Variable Capacity, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11487 LNCS, pp. 223-233, (2019); Nguyen, Su, Dynamic multi-objective job shop scheduling: A genetic programming approach, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 505, pp. 251-282, (2013); Ðurasević, Marko, Adaptive scheduling on unrelated machines with genetic programming, Applied Soft Computing, 48, pp. 419-430, (2016); Dumić, Mateja, Evolving priority rules for resource constrained project scheduling problem with genetic programming, Future Generation Computer Systems, 86, pp. 211-221, (2018); Branke, Juergen, Automated Design of Production Scheduling Heuristics: A Review, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 1, pp. 110-124, (2016); Nguyen, Su, Automatic design of scheduling policies for dynamic multi-objective job shop scheduling via cooperative coevolution genetic programming, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 2, pp. 193-208, (2014)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","18758835; 10692509","","ICAEE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013871087"

Especially for multiple intersections, an appropriate control method should be able to regulate the traffic flow within the control area. The intersection signal-timing problem is crucial for ensuring efficient traffic operations, with the key issues being the determination of a traffic model and the design of an optimization algorithm. So, an optimization method for signalized intersections integrating a multi-objective model and an NSGAIII-DAE algorithm is established in this paper. Firstly, the multi-objective model is constructed including the usual signal control delay and traffic capacity indices. In addition, the conflict delay caused by right-turning vehicles crossing straight-going non-motor vehicles is considered and combined with the proposed algorithm, enabling the traffic model to better balance the traffic efficiency of intersections without adding infrastructure. Secondly, to address the challenges of diversity and convergence faced by the classic NSGA-III algorithm in solving traffic models with high-dimensional search spaces, a denoising autoencoder (DAE) is adopted to learn the compact representation of the original high-dimensional search space. Some genetic operations are performed in the compressed space and then mapped back to the original search space through the DAE. As a result, an appropriate balance between the local and global searching in an iteration can be achieved. To validate the proposed method, numerical experiments were conducted using actual traffic data from intersections in Jinzhou, China. The numerical results show that the signal control delay and conflict delay are significantly reduced compared with the existing algorithm, and the optimal reduction is 33.7% and 31.3%, respectively. The capacity value obtained by the proposed method in this paper is lower than that of the compared algorithm, but it is also 11.5% higher than that of the current scheme in this case. The comparisons and discussions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method designed for improving the efficiency of signalized intersections. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","denoising autoencoder; intelligent transportation; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; signalized intersections","Efficiency; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Auto encoders; De-noising; Denoising autoencoder; Intelligent transportation; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-III; Optimization method; Search spaces; Signalized intersection; Traffic modeling; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; article; China; denoising autoencoder; multiobjective optimization","","","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61272509), Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. G2022041009L), the Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province (No. 2021GY-072), the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Natural Science Foundation (No. 2022MS06007), and the Scientific Research Project of Ankang University (No. 2021AYPT11).","Dadashova, Bahar, Multivariate time series analysis of traffic congestion measures in urban areas as they relate to socioeconomic indicators, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 75, (2021); Wang, Jian, Real-time deployable and robust cooperative control strategy for a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles by factoring uncertain vehicle dynamics, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 163, pp. 88-118, (2022); Wang, Jian, Worst-case traffic assignment model for mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles and connected and autonomous vehicles by factoring in the uncertain link capacity, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 140, (2022); Laña, Ibai, Road Traffic Forecasting: Recent Advances and New Challenges, IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, 10, 2, pp. 93-109, (2018); undefined; Chen, Peng, Comparison of Variability of Individual Vehicle Delay and Average Control Delay at Signalized Intersections, Transportation Research Record, 2553, 1, pp. 128-137, (2016); undefined; Highway Capacity Manual A Conceptual and Research History Volume 2 Signalized and Unsignalized Intersections, (2020); Zhao, Dongbin, Computational intelligence in urban traffic signal control: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews, 42, 4, pp. 485-494, (2012); Jalili, Shahin, Application of metaheuristics for signal optimisation in transportation networks: A comprehensive survey, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 63, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","14248220","","","37514597","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166012098"

The first method is based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), while the second one is based on the NSGA-III algorithm. The focus is on the reduction of the cogging torque (CT), which acts upon the rotor when the IPM is not powered, and the current that flows through the three windings is 0. The influence of the CT over the motor operation is a negative one, inducing vibrations that are not desired. The limitation of these influences is the desired way for improvement. The optimizations applied entailed the change of the geometrical configuration of the stator whilst maintaining the exterior dimensions unaltered.

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary approach to automatically generate finite state machines (FSMs) based on bug reports written in natural language, to automatically capture incorrect software behaviour. These FSMs can then be used by testers to both exercise the reported bugs and create tests that can potentially reveal new bugs. The FSM generation is guided by a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) that simultaneously minimises three objectives: size of the models, number of unrealistic states (over-generalisation), and number of states not covered by the models (under-generalisation). We assess the feasibility of our approach for 10 real-world software programs by exploiting three different MOEAs (NSGA-II, NSGA-III and MOEA/D) and benchmarking them with the baseline tool KLFA. Our results show that KLFA is not practical to be used with real-world software, because it generates models that over generalise software behaviour. Among the three MOEAs, NSGA-II obtained significantly better results than the other two for all 10 programs, detecting a greater number of bugs for 90% of the programs. We also studied the differences in quality and model performance when MOEAs are guided by only two objectives rather than three during the evolution. We found that the use of under-approximation (or over-approximation) and size as objectives generates infeasible solutions. On the other hand, using as objectives over-approximation and under-approximation generates feasible solutions yet still worse than those obtained using all three objectives for 100% of the cases. The size objective acts as a diversity factor. As a consequence, an algorithm guided by all three objectives avoids local optima, controls the size of the models, and makes the results more diverse and closer to the optimal Pareto set. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Model inference; Multi-objective optimisation; Search-based software engineering","Evolutionary algorithms; Pareto principle; Program debugging; Software testing; Bug reports; Finite states machine; Generalisation; Model inference; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Real-world; Search-based; Search-based software engineering; Software behavior; Multiobjective optimization","","","The work of G.

These DRs were usually designed for optimising a single criterion and work poorly when solving multi-objective (MO) problems. In recent years, we have seen an increase of research dealing with automated design of DRs using genetic programming (GP), which has enabled the application of several evolutionary MO optimisation methods to create DRs for MO problems. However, for each considered MO problem new DRs need to be evolved, which can be computationally expensive. Motivated by this, we propose a novel methodology to combine existing DRs evolved for optimising individual criteria into ensembles appropriate for optimising multiple criteria simultaneously. For this purpose, we adapt the existing simple ensemble construction (SEC) method to construct ensembles of DRs for optimising MO problems. The method is evaluated on several MO scheduling problems and compared with DRs evolved by NSGA-II and NSGA-III. The obtained results show that for most problems the proposed method constructed ensembles that significantly outperform DRs developed with standard MO algorithms. Furthermore, we propose the application of evolved MO rules and ensembles on problems with a smaller number of criteria and demonstrate that with such a strategy similar or better performance is achieved compared to evolving DRs for such problems directly, which demonstrates theif reusability and generalisation potential. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dispatching rules; Ensembles; Hyper-heuristic; Multi-objective optimisation; Unrelated machines environment","Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic methods; Reusability; Dispatching rules; Ensemble; Hyper-heuristics; Machine environment; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Simple++; Unrelated machine environment; Unrelated machines; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work has been supported in part by Croatian Science Foundation under the project IP-2019-04-4333 and by the Spanish State Agency for Research (AEI) under research project PID2019-106263RB-I00.

One of the most energy-consuming parts of an application is images. This paper, first, investigates that there is a correlation between energy consumption and image quality as well as image file size. Therefore, these two can be considered as a proxy for energy consumption. In the next step, we focused on proposing a multi-objective strategy to enhance image quality and reduce image file size based on the quantisation table (QT) in JPEG image compression. To this end, we have used two general multi-objective approaches: scalarisation and Pareto-based. In this paper, we embed our strategy into five scalarisation algorithms, including energy-aware multi-objective genetic algorithm (EnMOGA), energy-aware multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (EnMOPSO), energy-aware multi-objective differential evolution (EnMODE), energy-aware multi-objective evolutionary strategy (EnMOES), and energy-aware multi-objective pattern search (EnMOPS). Also, two Pareto-based methods, including a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a reference-point-based NSGA-II (NSGA-III) are used for the embedding scheme, and two Pareto-based algorithms, EnNSGAII and EnNSGAIII, are presented. With our proposed scalarisation method, user's preferences can be set before starting the optimisation process and the algorithm generates only one solution based on the preference, while our Pareto-based approaches generate a set of solutions so that a user can select one of the preferred solutions after the optimisation process. Experimental studies show that the performance of the baseline algorithm is improved by embedding the proposed strategy into metaheuristic algorithms. In particular, EnMOGA, EnMOPS, and EnNSGA-II can perform competitively, among others. From the results, the baseline algorithm in all cases and in comparison to all algorithms yields the worst results. Among the scalarisation methods, EnMOGA and EnMOPS can achieve the first rank in 6 and 7 out of 13 cases and the second rank in 7 and 5 cases in terms of objective function. Also, EnMOES achieved the fifth or worst rank among the scalarisation algorithms. Regarding the Pareto-based algorithms, the table shows that EnNSGAII outperforms EnNSGAIII in 10 out of 13 cases in terms of hyper-volume measure, while it fails in 3 cases. Furthermore, we statistically verify the proposed algorithm's effectiveness based on the Wilcoxon-signed rank test. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the parameters is provided.

Indeed, the use of containers enables better modularity, reusability, and portability compared to other technologies. As the complexity of software systems is dramatically increasing, it is critical to enable optimal usage of the needed resources to execute them such as memory and CPU. Thus, different scheduling strategies are proposed to select the most suitable nodes to execute a set of containers. For instance, the default strategy in the Docker Swarm kit scheduling framework is based on an equal distribution of the containers between nodes independent of their sizes and consumed resources. However, balancing the containers' workload is a complex problem due to the conflicting objectives of minimizing the number of selected nodes, minimizing the number of containers per node, the number of changes compared to the original schedule, and the coupling between containers allocated to different nodes. To deal with those conflicting scheduling objectives, we propose a scheduler based on a many-objective optimization approach for scheduling the execution of containers between multiple nodes. The proposed approach aims at finding the best allocation for containers in nodes that leads to efficient utilization of resources. To evaluate our approach, we compared the performance of multiple many and multi-objective techniques based on NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and IBEA algorithms using 48 Docker-related systems and the results show that NSGA-III outperforms the other algorithms in quality attributes as well as in CPU, Memory and Network usage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Container scheduling; docker; many-objective optimization","Complex networks; Computer software reusability; Job shop scheduling; Reusability; Container scheduling; Docker; Dynamic softwares; Job-Shop scheduling; Many-objective optimizations; Minimizing the number of; Optimisations; Processor scheduling; Software; Workload balancing; Containers","","","","International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, (2017); Linux Journal, (2014); 2017 Annual Container Adoption Survey Huge Growth in Containers, (2020); Senington, Richard, Using docker for factory system software management: Experience report, Procedia CIRP, 72, pp. 659-664, (2018); What is Docker, (2021); What is Mesos by Apache, (2021); What is Kubernetes, (2021); Docker Scheduling Strategy, (2021); Kaewkasi, Chanwit, Improvement of container scheduling for Docker using Ant Colony Optimization, pp. 254-259, (2017); Guerrero, Carlos, Genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization of container allocation in cloud architecture, Journal of Grid Computing, 16, 1, pp. 113-135, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","19391374","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149385004"

However, existing studies usually only consider the necessary logical constraints, ignoring descriptions of practical scenarios and corresponding complex constraints, which limit the designed algorithms in problems with such scenarios and constraints. This study focuses on the many-objective repetitive project scheduling problem considering practical scenarios with complex constraints (MRPSP-PSCC). Various constraints are described under flexible matching/mapping between multi-crew, multi-mode, and multi-section scenarios. A many-objective project scheduling model is proposed for synchronous optimization of time, cost, quality, resource usage, and interruption time. The multiphase balance of diversity and convergence nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (B-NSGA-III) with unique advantages for continuous many-objective optimization problems is transformed for discrete many-objective optimization. A series of unique designs is employed in the algorithm, including three-layer coding rules, constraint handling, and local search, to improve the problem-solving efficiency of the algorithm. The effectiveness and superiority of the model and algorithm for MRPSP-PSCC were verified through a case study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Genetic algorithms; Scheduling; Complex constraints; Flexible matching; Logical constraints; Many-objective optimizations; Multi-section; Multimodes; Project scheduling; Project scheduling problem; Scheduling models; Scheduling optimization; Constraint handling; algorithm; optimization; research","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 71801010, 62132003","Adeli, Hojjat, Augmented lagrangian genetic algorithm for structural optimization, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 104-118, (1994); Adeli, Hojjat, Scheduling/cost optimization and neural dynamics model for construction, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 123, 4, pp. 450-458, (1997); Construction Scheduling Cost Optimization and Management A New Model Based on Neurocomputing and Object Technologies, (2001); Adeli, Hojjat, Distributed genetic algorithm for structural optimization, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 8, 3, pp. 156-163, (1995); Agdas, Duzgun, Utility of Genetic Algorithms for Solving Large-Scale Construction Time-Cost Trade-Off Problems, Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 32, 1, (2018); Agrama, Fatma Abd El Mohayyi, Multi-objective genetic optimization for scheduling a multi-storey building, Automation in Construction, 44, pp. 119-128, (2014); Akhand, Muhammad Aminul Haque, Discrete Spider Monkey Optimization for Travelling Salesman Problem, Applied Soft Computing, 86, (2020); Alavipour, S.

In various applications, the network is deployed in a large-scale area, which affects the efficiency of the data collection, and the network is subject to multiple attacks that impact the reliability of the collected data. Hence, data collection should consider trust in sources and routing nodes. This makes trust an additional optimization objective of the data gathering in addition to energy consumption, traveling time, and cost. Joint optimization of the goals requires conducting multiobjective optimization. This article proposes a modified social class multiobjective particle swarm optimization (SC-MOPSO) method. The modified SC-MOPSO method is featured by application-dependent operators named interclass operators. In addition, it includes solution generation, adding and deleting rendezvous points, and moving to the upper and lower class. Considering that SC-MOPSO provides a set of nondominated solutions as a Pareto front, we employed one of the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, i.e., simple additive sum (SAW), for selecting one of the solutions from the Pareto front. The results show that both SC-MOPSO and SAW are superior in terms of domination. The set coverage of SC-MOPSO is 0.06 dominant over NSGA-II compared with only a mastery of 0.04 of NSGA-II over SC-MOPSO.

The algorithm is called a multi-objective fitness dependent optimizer (MOFDO) and is equipped with all five types of knowledge (situational, normative, topographical, domain, and historical knowledge) as in FDO. MOFDO is tested on two standard benchmarks for the performance-proof purpose: classical ZDT test functions, which is a widespread test suite that takes its name from its authors Zitzler, Deb, and Thiele, and on IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation benchmark (CEC-2019) multi-modal multi-objective functions. MOFDO results are compared to the latest variant of multi-objective particle swarm optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm third improvement (NSGA-III), and multi-objective dragonfly algorithm. The comparative study shows the superiority of MOFDO in most cases and comparative results in other cases. Moreover, MOFDO is used for optimizing real-world engineering problems (e.g., welded beam design problems). It is observed that the proposed algorithm successfully provides a wide variety of well-distributed feasible solutions, which enable the decision-makers to have more applicable-comfort choices to consider. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Fitness dependent optimizer; Multi-objective optimization algorithm; Swarm intelligence; Welded beam design","Benchmarking; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Screening; Swarm intelligence; Welding; Beam design; Fitness dependent optimizer; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimization algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Performance; Test-functions; Welded beam design; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Arallel Problem Solving from Nature Ppsn Xi, (2010); Brockhoff, Dimo, Analyzing hypervolume indicator based algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5199 LNCS, pp. 651-660, (2008); Appl Soft Comput, (2016); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Coello, Carlos A., Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 8, 3, pp. 256-279, (2004); Evolutionary Methods for Design Optimisation and Control, (2002); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Jain, Himanshu, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point based nondominated sorting approach, Part II: Handling constraints and extending to an adaptive approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 602-622, (2014); Pradhan, Pyari Mohan, Solving multiobjective problems using cat swarm optimization, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 3, pp. 2956-2964, (2012)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333058; 09410643","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148464830"

The proposed problem is modeled with minimum assumptions about the procedure attributes and can handle most of the commonly imposed restrictions in the field of home healthcare delivery. Under the imposed restrictions, the model is designed to provide selection (for caregivers and patients), assignment, scheduling, and routing decisions. In addition to some minor modifications in ‘workload balance’ constraints, a major focus of the work is to improve the quality of the schedule for the selected patients. To achieve this, we define and calculate the inconvenience caused by the unnecessarily scattered visits and their overlap with the patient-specific inconvenient time window. The model minimizes the total inconvenience cost for patients against the competitive goals of other stakeholders. Higher net profit, minimum loss of employed labor, balanced workload among staff, and maximization of fully served patients have been included as the other objectives. To solve the instances of the proposed home healthcare delivery problem, an efficient implementation for a reference point-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) is developed. After extensive parameter tuning using the Taguchi method of experimental design, the algorithm is used for generating a diverse set of non-dominated solutions for the decision-maker. In addition to the comparing the performance of NGSA-III with Multi-objective particle swarm optimization and Multi-objective grey wolf optimizer, experiments are also carried out to establish the relationship between patient convenience and net profit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Home health care; Inconvenient schedule; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Routing and scheduling","Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Home health care; Integer programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Taguchi methods; Delivery problems; Healthcare delivery; Home healthcare; Inconvenient schedule; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Net profits; NSGA-III; Objective approaches; Routing and scheduling; Multiobjective optimization","","","The support and the resources provided by ‘PARAM Shivay Facility’ under the National Supercomputing Mission, Government of India at the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi are gratefully acknowledged.","Akjiratikarl, Chananes, PSO-based algorithm for home care worker scheduling in the UK, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 53, 4, pp. 559-583, (2007); Anoshkina, Yulia, Technician teaming and routing with service-, cost- and fairness-objectives, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 135, pp. 868-880, (2019); Asghari, Mohammad, A green delivery-pickup problem for home hemodialysis machines; sharing economy in distributing scarce resources, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 134, (2020); Begur, Sachidanand V., An integrated spatial DSS for scheduling and routing home-health-care nurses, Interfaces, 27, 4, pp. 35-48, (1997); Bertels, Stefan, A hybrid setup for a hybrid scenario: Combining heuristics for the home health care problem, Computers and Operations Research, 33, 10, pp. 2866-2890, (2006); Bowers, John Andrew, Continuity of care in community midwifery, Health Care Management Science, 18, 2, pp. 195-204, (2015); Braekers, Kris, A bi-objective home care scheduling problem: Analyzing the trade-off between costs and client inconvenience, European Journal of Operational Research, 248, 2, pp. 428-443, (2016); Bredström, David, Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints, European Journal of Operational Research, 191, 1, pp. 19-31, (2008); Çakırgil, Seray, An integrated solution approach for multi-objective, multi-skill workforce scheduling and routing problems, Computers and Operations Research, 118, (2020); Cappanera, Paola, Demand uncertainty in robust Home Care optimization, Omega (United Kingdom), 80, pp. 95-110, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147984506"

Experimental observations on free-space and tree Path Loss Model (PLM) based sensor node deployment strategies in a cropping period have shown network disconnectivity due to incorrect assessment of excess attenuation caused by dynamically varying vegetation height and density during the monitoring period. To address the challenge, an empirically formulated PLM is proposed to estimate the excess attenuation at different crop development stages of medium grass vegetation. Further, using the formulated PLM, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) multi-objective optimization is performed to generate initial node deployment with a heterogeneous transmission range. To address the issue of over-coverage, transmitter output power scheduling is performed with predefined upper limit derived from the NSGA-III optimization. The output power is dynamically scheduled during the monitoring period based on changes in the captured RSS to minimize over-coverage.

The MaOSCA algorithm’s capabilities are enhanced by incorporating multiple features that balance exploration and exploitation, direct the search towards promising areas, and prevent search stagnation. The MaOSCA’s performance is evaluated against popular algorithms such as the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III), the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) integrated with Differential Evolution (MOEADDE), the Many-objective Particle Swarm Optimizer (MaOPSO), and the Many-objective JAYA Algorithm (MaOJAYA) across various test suites, including DTLZ1-DTLZ7 with 5, 9, and 15 objectives and car cab design, water resources management, car side impact, marine design, and 10-bar truss engineering design problems. The performance evaluation is carried out using various performance metrics. The MaOSCA demonstrates its ability to achieve well-converged and diversified solutions for most problems.

Most candidate solutions become nondominated during the evolutionary process, thus leading to the failure of producing off-spring toward Pareto-optimal front with diversity. Can we find a more effective way to select nondominated solutions and resolve this issue? To answer this critical question, this work proposes to evolve solutions through line complex rather than solution points in Euclidean space. First, Plücker coordinates are used to project solution points to line complex composed of position vectors and momentum ones. Besides position vectors of the solution points, momentum vectors are used to extend the comparability of non-dominated solutions and enhance selection pressure. Then, a new distance function designed for high-dimensional space is proposed to replace Euclidean distance as a more effective distance-based estimator. Based on them, a novel many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA) is proposed by integrating a line complex-based environmental selection strategy into the NSGA-III framework. The proposed algorithm is compared with the state of the art on widely used benchmark problems with up to 15 objectives.

However, when solving MOPs which are characterized by discontinuous and/or degenerated PFs, it is essential to identify the regions where no solutions are bound to exist and identify the corresponding reference vectors referred to as ineffective reference vectors. In literature, various frameworks were proposed to classify the reference vectors into effective and ineffective during the process of evolution based on their association with the solutions in the population. However, due to the stochastic nature of the evolutionary process, some of the effective weight vectors may fail to associate with the solutions in the population and are misclassified as ineffective. Therefore, the region corresponding to the particular reference vector should be thoroughly explored before labeling it as ineffective. In this paper, the reference vectors are divided into three classes, namely, effective, possible ineffective and true ineffective vectors. Then, the regions corresponding to the possible ineffective reference vectors are thoroughly explored before finally classifying them as effective or ineffective. In order to facilitate the exploration corresponding to the different regions, an adaptive mating selection based on weighted I<inf>SDE+ </inf>(I<inf>SDE+ </inf> w) is proposed. In addition, the adaptive mating selection also facilitates the exploration of sparser regions once all the reference vectors are classified as effective or ineffective. The performance of the MOEA with the proposed Adaptive Mating Selection, referred to as AMS-MOEA significantly outperforms or is comparable to MOEADAWA, NSGA-III, ANSGA-III, MOEA/DD, RVEA, TDEA, 1by1EA, I<inf>SDE+ </inf> and iRVEA in 65%, 93.75%, 88.75%, 76.25%, 87.5%, 77.5%, 93.75%, 76.25% and 86.25% of cases, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Decomposition; Diversity; Dominance; Indicator; Many-objective optimization","Multiobjective optimization; Stochastic systems; Vectors; Convergence; Diversity; Dominance; Many-objective optimizations; Matings; Multi-objective optimization problem; Pareto front; Process of evolution; Reference vectors; Selection based; Evolutionary algorithms","","","This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2021R1I1A3049810).","Fleming, P.

However, the storage problem needs to be solved with the increasing number of blocks in the blockchain network. Cloud storage optimization is an effective way to solve the storage issue, which selects and stores parts of blocks to the cloud. Precisely, block selection can be described as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) and solved by evolutionary algorithms (EAs). To obtain well results of block selection, an improved NSGA-III algorithm based on deep Q-networks (DQN), termed NSGA-DQN, is proposed in this paper, which aims to maintain well convergence and diversity of the population. This way, a set of suitable solutions is obtained to determine the number of blocks stored to the cloud, and the storage problem can be solved effectively. To be specific, DQN creates a decision-making agent to maximize the expected reward by learning a policy that evaluates QQ values of each action in each state. In the proposed selection mechanism, the reward values are set according to the convergence and diversity of the population, and the actions correspond to the individuals. This way, our method can determine a set of individuals that maximizes the convergence and diversity of the population. In addition, an adaptive maximum reward enhancement module (AMREM) is developed to further enhance the maximum expected reward by updating the new better reward and modifying the replay memory. We conduct the experimental study on block selection, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to five state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; cloud storage; deep Q-networks (DQN); genetic algorithm; multiobjective optimization","Cloud storage; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Block-chain; Cloud storages; Cloud-computing; Convergence; Deep Q-network; Multi-objectives optimization; Number of blocks; Optimisations; Storage optimization; Blockchain","","","","Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Jirgensons, Merija, Blockchain and the Future of Digital Learning Credential Assessment and Management, Journal of Teacher Education for Sustainability, 20, 1, pp. 145-156, (2018); Novo, Oscar, Blockchain Meets IoT: An Architecture for Scalable Access Management in IoT, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 2, pp. 1184-1195, (2018); Wu, Mingli, A Comprehensive Survey of Blockchain: From Theory to IoT Applications and beyond, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 5, pp. 8114-8154, (2019); Ramasamy, Lakshmana Kumar, Blockchain for securing aerial communications: Potentials, solutions, and research directions, Physical Communication, 47, (2021); Thakur, Tanvi, Smart water conservation through a machine learning and blockchain-enabled decentralized edge computing network, Applied Soft Computing, 106, (2021); Wang, Nana, The algorithmic composition for music copyright protection under deep learning and blockchain, Applied Soft Computing, 112, (2021); Xu, Chenhan, Making Big Data Open in Edges: A Resource-Efficient Blockchain-Based Approach, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 30, 4, pp. 870-882, (2019); Hassanzadeh-Nazarabadi, Yahya, LightChain: Scalable DHT-Based Blockchain, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 32, 10, pp. 2582-2593, (2021); Tokenview, (2022)","","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10459219","","ITDSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149372089"

In order to make the algorithm have a good distribution, distribution vector is introduced for the procedure of disturbance. Moreover, a self-learning process is corporated to ascertain the value of disturbance ratio.

Under these situations, a flexible job-shop rescheduling problem (FJRP) with both new job insertion and machine PM is investigated. First, an imperfect PM (IPM) model is established to determine the optimal maintenance plan for each machine, and the optimality is proven. Second, in order to jointly optimize the production scheduling and maintenance planning, a multiobjective optimization model is developed. Third, to deal with this model, an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III with adaptive reference vector (NSGA-III/ARV) is proposed, in which a hybrid initialization method is designed to obtain a high-quality initial population and a critical-path-based local search (LS) mechanism is constructed to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. In the numerical simulation, the effect of parameter setting on the NSGA-III/ARV is investigated by the Taguchi experimental design. After that, the superiority of the improved operators and the overall performance of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated. Next, the comparison of two IPM models is carried out, which verifies the effectiveness of the designed IPM model.

Given the utility functions of different stakeholders, the meta-model was coupled with the NSGA-II and NSGA-III optimization models. Results show that the latter performed better. Lastly, to obtain the best design alternative and a compromise among the stakeholders, Pareto optimal solutions were examined using Social Choice Rules and the Unanimity Fallback Bargaining method. The application of the proposed method in Jareh Dam, Iran, showed that the optimum scenario (selected by the Unanimity Fallback Bargaining method) enhance the energy dissipation and cavitation index by about 12.5 and 9.5%, respectively, while compared to the current chute-flip bucket system the cost remained almost constant. The results provide useful knowledge regarding the robust design of hydraulic structures, taking into account the conflicting objectives of different stakeholders. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chute-flip bucket design; Flow-3D Model; NSGA-II and NSGA-III; Social Choice Rules; Unanimity Fallback Bargaining method","3D modeling; Decision making; Design; Pareto principle; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Chute-flip bucket design; Conflicting preferences; FLOW-3D; Flow-3d model; NSGA-II; NSGA-II and NSGA-III; Social choice rules; Unanimity fallback bargaining method; Energy dissipation","","","","Audet, Charles, Performance indicators in multiobjective optimization, European Journal of Operational Research, 292, 2, pp. 397-422, (2021); Bananmah, Mohammad, Optimizing chute-flip bucket system based on meta-modelling approach, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 47, 5, pp. 584-595, (2020); Bayon, Arnau, Influence of VOF technique, turbulence model and discretization scheme on the numerical simulation of the non-aerated, skimming flow in stepped spillways, Journal of Hydro-Environment Research, 19, pp. 137-149, (2018); Bayon, Arnau, Performance assessment of OpenFOAM and FLOW-3D in the numerical modeling of a low Reynolds number hydraulic jump, Environmental Modelling and Software, 80, pp. 322-335, (2016); undefined, (2010); Brams, Steven J., Fallback Bargaining, Group Decision and Negotiation, 10, 4, pp. 287-316, (2001); Proc 24th Icold Congress Kyoto Q, (2012); Chanel, Paul G., Assessment of spillway modeling using computational fluid dynamics, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 35, 12, pp. 1481-1485, (2008); Chanson, Hubert, Self-aerated flows on chutes and spillways, Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 119, 2, pp. 220-243, (1993); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145773108"

An anti-aircraft system consists of various types of functional entities interacting to destroy the hostile aircraft moving in high speed. The connecting structure of combat entities in it is of great importance for supporting the normal process of the system. In this paper, we explore the optimizing strategy of the structure of the anti-aircraft network by establishing extra communication channels between the combat entities. Firstly, the thought of combat network model (CNM) is borrowed to model the anti-aircraft system as a heterogeneous network. Secondly, the optimization objectives are determined as the survivability and the accuracy of the system. To specify these objectives, the information chain and accuracy chain are constructed based on CNM. The causal strength (CAST) logic and influence network (IN) are introduced to illustrate the establishment of the accuracy chain. Thirdly, the optimization constraints are discussed and set in three aspects: time, connection feasibility and budget. The time constraint network (TCN) is introduced to construct the timing chain and help to detect the timing consistency. Then, the process of the multi-objective optimization of the structure of the anti-aircraft system is designed. Finally, a simulation is conducted to prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. Non-dominated sorting based genetic algorithm-II (NSGA2) is used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and two other algorithms including non-dominated sorting based genetic algorithm-III (NSGA3) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-II (SPEA2) are employed as comparisons. The deciders and system builders can make the anti-aircraft system improved in the survivability and accuracy in the combat reality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anti-aircraft system; causal strength (CAST) logic; combat network model (CNM); influence network (IN); optimization; time constraint network (TCN)","Budget control; Chains; Computer circuits; Heterogeneous networks; Multiobjective optimization; Structural optimization; Anti-aircraft systems; Causal strength logic; Combat network model; Constraint networks; Influence network; Influence networks; Network models; Optimisations; Time constraint network; Time constraints; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72071206).","Li, Longyue, Optimal index shooting policy for layered missile defense system, Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, 31, 1, pp. 118-129, (2020); Ender, Tommer R., Systems-of-systems analysis of ballistic missile defense architecture effectiveness through surrogate modeling and simulation, IEEE Systems Journal, 4, 2, pp. 156-166, (2010); Liu, Xiaokai, Robust signal recognition algorithm based on machine learning in heterogeneous networks, Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, 27, 2, pp. 333-342, (2016); Li, Jichao, Meta-Path-Based Weapon-Target Recommendation in Heterogeneous Combat Network, IEEE Systems Journal, 13, 4, pp. 4433-4441, (2019); Li, Jichao, Disintegration of Operational Capability of Heterogeneous Combat Networks under Incomplete Information, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 50, 12, pp. 5172-5179, (2020); Guo, Xiaochuan, Missile weapon system-of-systems optimization method based on information entropy, (2016); Garrett, Robert K., Managing the interstitials, a System of Systems framework suited for the Ballistic Missile Defense System, Systems Engineering, 14, 1, pp. 87-109, (2011); Proc of the International Conference on Modelling and Simulation, (2009); Network Centric Warfare Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority, (1999); Network Centric Warfare how Navies Learned to Fight Smarter Through Three World Wars, (2009)","","Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information","","","","","","16711793","","JSEEF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160209382"

NSGA-II/SDR (NSGA-II with a strengthened dominance relation) is an improved NSGA-II, created by replacing the traditional Pareto dominance relation with a new dominance relation, termed SDR, which is better than the original algorithm in solving small-scale MaOPs with few decision variables, but performs poorly in large-scale MaOPs. To address these problems, we added the following improvements to the NSGA-II/SDR to obtain NSGA-II/SDR-OLS, which enables it to better achieve a balance between population convergence and diversity when solving large-scale MaOPs: (1) The opposition-based learning (OBL) strategy is introduced in the initial population initialization stage, and the final initial population is formed by the initial population and the opposition-based population, which optimizes the quality and convergence of the population; (2) the local search (LS) strategy is introduced to expand the diversity of populations by finding neighborhood solutions, in order to avoid solutions falling into local optima too early. NSGA-II/SDR-OLS is compared with the original algorithm on nine benchmark problems to verify the effectiveness of its improvement. Then, we compare our algorithm with six existing algorithms, which are promising region-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (PREA), a scalable small subpopulation-based covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (S3-CMA-ES), a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm guided by growing neural gas (DEA-GNG), a reference vector-guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA), NSGA-II with conflict-based partitioning strategy (NSGA-II-conflict), and a genetic algorithm using reference-point-based non-dominated sorting (NSGA-III).The proposed algorithm has achieved the best results in the vast majority of test cases, indicating that our algorithm has strong competitiveness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","evolutionary algorithm; large-scale optimization; local search; many-objective optimization; opposition-based learning","","","","This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Krishna, Rahul, ConEx: Efficient Exploration of Big-Data System Configurations for Better Performance, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 48, 3, pp. 893-909, (2022); Cheng, Shi, Evolutionary computation for solving search-based data analytics problems, Artificial Intelligence Review, 54, 2, pp. 1321-1348, (2021); Guo, Guanghao, Low power application specific SoC chip for uncooled infrared image processing, Hongwai Yu Haomibo Xuebao/Journal of Infrared and Millimeter Waves, 42, 1, pp. 122-131, (2023); Sreedhara, Sachin, Practical Application of Digital Image Processing in Measuring Concrete Crack Widths in Field Studies, Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction, 28, 1, (2023); Hu, Ying, Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization for Feature Selection with Fuzzy Cost, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 51, 2, pp. 874-888, (2021); Song, Xianfang, A Fast Hybrid Feature Selection Based on Correlation-Guided Clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization for High-Dimensional Data, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 52, 9, pp. 9573-9586, (2022); Tahmasebi, Sahar, An ideal point based many-objective optimization for community detection of complex networks, Information Sciences, 502, pp. 125-145, (2019); Cui, Zhihua, Hybrid many-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm for green coal production problem, Information Sciences, 518, pp. 256-271, (2020); El-Shorbagy, M.

Four algorithms, MOPSO, NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D, were evaluated in terms of their convergence, diversity, efficiency, and robustness. Unlike previous studies that focused on single-objective optimization or ignored seasonal variations, our approach results in a more comprehensive and sustainable design for EV charging systems. The proposed system includes a 223-kW photovoltaic system, an 80-kW wind turbine, and seven Lithium-Ion battery banks, achieving a total net present cost of USD 564,846, a levelized cost of electricity of 0.2521 USD/kWh, and a loss of power supply probability of 1.21%. NSGA-II outperforms the other algorithms in terms of convergence and diversity, while NSGA-III is the most efficient, and MOEA/D has the highest robustness. The findings contribute to the development of efficient and reliable renewable energy systems for urban areas, emphasizing the importance of considering both economic and reliability factors in the design process.

Most existing studies rely on the similar assumption that the heterogeneous units are subject to periodic inspections and identical in terms of their aging situations and the numbers of resisted shocks. In practice, it is often adequate to trigger a unit individually in the event of a single shock, which intensifies the degradation of that unit, accordingly, requiring a sooner inspection to ensure its safety. In this study, the stochastic dependency among units is addressed firstly by introducing a novel activation sequence. Secondly, an adaptive system-level inspection policy is proposed by prioritizing the unit with a worse state. Finally, we take advantage of Monte Carlo methods to simulate the whole process and estimate two objectives, referring to the average system unavailability and maintenance cost, in a designed service time. It is found that the two objectives are contradictory through numerical examples. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) algorithm, therefore, has been employed to find the optimal solutions in system unavailability and cost, which provide clues for practitioners in decision-making. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1oo2 configuration; Activation sequence; Adaptive inspection; Maintenance optimization; NSGA-III algorithm; Redundant structure","Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Inspection; Maintenance; Monte Carlo methods; Stochastic systems; Structural optimization; 1oo2 configuration; Activation sequence; Adaptive inspection; Inspection and maintenance; Inspection optimization; Maintenance optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III algorithm; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Redundant structure; System unavailability; Chemical activation; article; decision making; genetic algorithm; human; Monte Carlo method; physician; stochastic model","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71971181 , 72032005 and 72101170 ) and by Research Grant Council of Hong Kong ( 11203519 and 11200621 ).

To improve the robustness, ensemble feature selection (EFS) has been developed with considerable attention recently where different aggregation methods are applied. This paper proposed a four-stage EFS method called re-ranking and TOPSIS-based ensemble feature selection (RTEFS). In the first stage of RTEFS, features are extracted from the text corpus. The second one is to construct a union subset yielded by six filter-based FS methods out of preprocessing feature vectors. Then a re-ranking stage is applied to evaluate those features from such subset. The TOPSIS method is used to aggregate the ranking lists ranked by two FS groups in the ensemble feature ranking stage. In the final stage, the two fused rankings are ensembled via a multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-III.

As we know, how to find the changing Pareto front quickly and accurately is challenging during the process of solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). In addition, most solutions obey different distributions in decision space and the performance of NSGA-III when dealing with DMOPs should be further improved. In this paper, centroid distance is proposed and combined into NSGA-III with transfer learning together for DMOPs, called TC_NSGAIII. Centroid distance-based strategy is regarded as a prediction method to prevent some inappropriate individuals through measuring the distance of the population centroid and reference points. After the distance strategy, transfer learning is used for generating an initial population using the past experience. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, NSGAIII, Tr_NSGAIII (NSGA-III combining with transfer learning only), Ce_NSGAIII (NSGA-III combining with centroid distance only), and TC_NSGAIII are compared. Seven state-of-the-art algorithms have been used for comparison on CEC 2015 benchmarks. Besides, transfer learning and centroid distance are regarded as a dynamic strategy, which is incorporated into three static algorithms, and the performance improvement is measured. What’s more, twelve benchmark functions from CEC 2015 and eight sets of parameters in each function are used in our experiments. The experimental results show that the performance of algorithms can be greatly improved through the proposed approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective; NSGA-III; Transfer learning","","","","","Luna, Francisco, Approaching the cell switch-off problem in 5G ultra-dense networks with dynamic multi-objective optimization, Future Generation Computer Systems, 110, pp. 876-891, (2020); Alves Ribeiro, Victor Henrique, A novel dynamic multi-criteria ensemble selection mechanism applied to drinking water quality anomaly detection, Science of the Total Environment, 749, (2020); Li, Ji, Simulation-based solution for a dynamic multi-crane-scheduling problem in a steelmaking shop, International Journal of Production Research, 58, 22, pp. 6970-6984, (2020); Kim, Rebecca, A Tchebycheff-based multi-objective combined with a PSO–SQP dynamic real-time optimization framework for cycling energy systems, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 156, pp. 180-194, (2020); Feng, Yanhong, Opposition-based learning monarch butterfly optimization with Gaussian perturbation for large-scale 0-1 knapsack problem, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 67, pp. 454-468, (2018); Muruganantham, Arrchana, Evolutionary Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Via Kalman Filter Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 46, 12, pp. 2862-2873, (2016); Zou, Fei, A knee-guided prediction approach for dynamic multi-objective optimization, Information Sciences, 509, pp. 193-209, (2020); Jiang, Shouyong, A Steady-State and Generational Evolutionary Algorithm for Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 21, 1, pp. 65-82, (2017); Wang, Gaige, Improving Metaheuristic Algorithms With Information Feedback Models, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 2, pp. 542-555, (2019); Gao, Da, Solving Fuzzy Job-Shop Scheduling Problem Using de Algorithm Improved by a Selection Mechanism, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 28, 12, pp. 3265-3275, (2020)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","21994536; 21986053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125624225"

The impact of supplier selection decisions made were quick and noteworthy on the healthcare profitability and total cost of medical equipment. Thus, there is an urgent need for decision support systems that address the optimal healthcare supplier selection problem, as this problem is addressed by a limited number of studies. Those studies addressed this problem mathematically or by using meta-heuristics methods. The focus of this work is to advance the meta-heuristics methods by considering more objectives rather than the utilized objectives. In this context, the optimal supplier selection problem for healthcare equipment was formulated as a mathematical model to expose the required objectives and constraints for the sake of searching for the optimal suppliers. Subsequently, the problem is realized as a multi-objective problem, with the help of this proposed model. The model has three minimization objectives: (1) transportation cost; (2) delivery time; and (3) the number of damaged items. The proposed system includes realistic constraints such as device quality, usability, and service quality. The model also takes into account capacity limits for each supplier. Next, it is proposed to adapt the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-III algorithm to choose the optimal suppliers. The results of the adapted NSGA-III have been compared with several heuristic algorithms and two meta-heuristic algorithms (i.e., particle swarm optimization and NSGA-II). The obtained results show that the adapted NSGA-III outperformed the methods of comparison. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","decision support system; healthcare; logistics services; meta-heuristics; NSGA-III; supplier selection","","","","","Song, Yanxing, Applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Smart Logistics: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 6, pp. 4250-4274, (2021); Sarabi, Elnaz Poormohammad, Developing a decision support system for logistics service provider selection employing fuzzy MULTIMOORA & BWM in mining equipment manufacturing, Applied Soft Computing, 98, (2021); Kritchanchai, Duangpun, Develop a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance, Supply Chain Forum, 19, 1, pp. 55-69, (2018); Singh, Sudhanshu, A data-driven approach to shared decision-making in a healthcare environment, OPSEARCH, 59, 2, pp. 732-746, (2022); Moons, Karen, Measuring the logistics performance of internal hospital supply chains – A literature study, Omega (United Kingdom), 82, pp. 205-217, (2019); Deshmukh, Ashish J., A review for supplier selection criteria and methods, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 145 CCIS, pp. 283-291, (2011); Vendors Vs Suppliers Whats the Difference; Komsiyah, Siti, Applications of the fuzzy ELECTRE method for decision support systems of cement vendor selection, Procedia Computer Science, 157, pp. 479-488, (2019); Krishankumar, R., Solving cloud vendor selection problem using intuitionistic fuzzy decision framework, Neural Computing and Applications, 32, 2, pp. 589-602, (2020); Davari, Soheil, Supplier selection in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment, Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society - NAFIPS, (2008)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151388674"

The first objective is defined as time cost, including transport time cost and waiting time cost. The second objective is defined as the number of short supplies. The allocation of supplies is taken into account together with the urgency degree in a disaster area (DA), and the DAs with different urgency degrees are given different minimum allocation quantities of supplies to achieve fairness to a maximum extent. To solve this complex problem, a multi-objective hyper-heuristic (MOHH) optimization framework based on an evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the framework, twelve low-level heuristics (LLHs) are designed with the actual information in the problem field being taken into account, and an online learning-based choice strategy is designed to choose high-quality and efficient LLHs. In addition, three acceptance criteria (AC) based on the D matrix are put forward to improve the performance of the MOHH framework. It is verified through comparative analysis experiments that the LLHs and the model are effective and the performance of the proposed multi-objective algorithm is better than that of NSGA-III and MOPSO. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emergency logistics; Hyper-heuristic algorithm; Location-allocation problem; Multi-objective problem","Disasters; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Location; Emergency logistics; Emergency rescue; Hyper-heuristic algorithms; Hyper-heuristics; Location allocation problem; Location-allocation algorithms; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Performance; Time cost; Evolutionary algorithms","","","This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (No. 51875524 ) and the Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology under Grant (No. DMETKF2022024 ).","Abd Aziz, Zalilah, Ant Colony Hyper-heuristics for Travelling Salesman Problem, Procedia Computer Science, 76, pp. 534-538, (2015); Ahmed, Leena N., Solving high school timetabling problems worldwide using selection hyper-heuristics, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 13, pp. 5463-5471, (2015); Allahbakhsh, Mohammad, Crowdsourcing planar facility location allocation problems, Computing, 101, 3, pp. 237-261, (2019); Baharmand, Hossein, Bi-objective multi-layer location–allocation model for the immediate aftermath of sudden-onset disasters, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 127, pp. 86-110, (2019); undefined, (2003); Castro, Olacir Rodrigues, Evaluating selection methods on hyper-heuristic multi-objective particle swarm optimization, Journal of Heuristics, 24, 4, pp. 581-616, (2018); undefined, (2000); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Geng, Jiaxin, Optimization of warehouse location and supplies allocation for emergency rescue under joint government–enterprise cooperation considering disaster victims’ distress perception, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 19, (2021); Ghasemi, Peiman, Uncertain multi-objective multi-commodity multi-period multi-vehicle location-allocation model for earthquake evacuation planning, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 350, pp. 105-132, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148546349"

An inappropriate routing scheme not only leads to higher delivery costs but also results in customers' dissatisfaction. The previous literature paid limited attention to the time-dependent difference among paths (between distribution centres and customers or between customers and customers). We developed a time-dependent vehicle routing model considering the differences among paths on the congested road (TDVRP-DP) for perishable product delivery. Given the availability of road setting-related data, we proposed a method to obtain the time-dependent travel time based on the historical traffic index. We built a TDVRP-DP model to minimize the total cost and minimize the dissatisfaction of customers. Solution algorithms with a dichotomy strategy for DP and new evolutionary operators based on several multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) were proposed. The computational results of different sizes of problems show that the dichotomy strategy for DP saves about 50% of the computation time and the new evolutionary operators improve the performance of the algorithm slightly in most cases; the NSGA-III-DN performs well for small size (with 20 customers) problems, and the RVEA-DN exhibited better performance for larger (with 50, and 100 customers) ones. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","MOEA; Perishable product delivery; Time-dependent travel time; Vehicle routing problem","","","","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Nos. 2020YJS095).","Amorim, Pedro Sanches, Managing perishability in production-distribution planning: A discussion and review, Flexible Services and Manufacturing Journal, 25, 3, pp. 389-413, (2013); Beijing Transport Institute, (2019); Chen, Lu, A multi-compartment vehicle routing problem in cold-chain distribution, Computers and Operations Research, 111, pp. 58-66, (2019); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016); Conrad, Ryan G., Algorithms to quantify impact of congestion on time-dependent real-world Urban Freight distribution networks, Transportation Research Record, 2168, pp. 104-113, (2010); Management Science, (1959); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Farahani, Poorya, Integrated production and distribution planning for perishable food products, Flexible Services and Manufacturing Journal, 24, 1, pp. 28-51, (2012); Ferguson, Mark E., How should a firm manage deteriorating inventory?, Production and Operations Management, 16, 3, pp. 306-321, (2007)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18661505; 11092858","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148425202"

Therefore, in this study, we focus on the integrated optimization of real-time order acceptance and flexible job-shop rescheduling with multi-level imperfect maintenance constraints. More precisely, (1) a multi-level imperfect maintenance model with minimal repair (MR), preventive maintenance (PM), overhaul maintenance (OM) and replacement is designed for each production machine, and the optimality is derived; (2) an integrated multi-objective optimization model is developed to characterize the concerned problem; and (3) an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III with adaptive reference vector (INSGA-III/ARV) is proposed to deal with the problem. In the numerical simulation, the effect of different order sorting rules is first analyzed. Second, the effectiveness of improved operators is demonstrated by internal analysis of the proposed algorithm. Third, the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing with the variants of five state-of-the-art algorithms. Fourth, the benefits of both the designed multi-level imperfect maintenance model and real-time order acceptance and scheduling (ROAS) strategy are proved by contrasting with other two traditional maintenance models and all order acceptance and scheduling (AOAS) strategy, respectively.

Processing the massive data generated by the large number of SMDs is becoming a big problem for mobile devices, servers, and wireless communication channels. A Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm partially mitigates this problem by deploying edge server nodes at the edge of wireless networks nearby SMDs, but the challenge still remains due to the limited computation capacity of MEC servers and the bandwidth of wireless channels. In addition, the dependency of tasks generated by applications on SMDs increases the complexity of the problem. In this paper, we propose a constrained multiobjective computation offloading optimization solution to resolve the problem of task dependency under limited resources. This solution improves the Quality of Service (QoS) through minimizing the latency, energy consumption, and rate of task failure caused by limited resources. We propose a two-staged hybrid computation offloading optimization method to solve the problem. In the first stage, the computation offloading decisions are made based on the preferences of tasks. Then, in the second stage, nearly optimal solutions are found using the modified Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). The overall efficiency of the proposed method is increased owing to the preference-based algorithm reinforcing the NSGA-III algorithm by generating a better initial population. The results of extensive experiments show that the efficiency of the proposed method is significantly better than the existing methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computation offloading optimization; Energy consumption; Latency; Multi-access edge computing; Task failure","computation offloading; Constrained optimization; Data handling; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Quality of service; Computation offloading; Computation offloading optimization; Edge computing; Energy-consumption; Latency; Multi-access edge computing; Multiaccess; Optimisations; Preference-based; Task failures; Energy utilization","","","Funding text 1: This work has been partially supported by the National Key R &D Program of China under Grant No. 2018YFB1800805, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61772345, 61902257, 61972261, the Pearl River Young Scholars funding of Shenzhen University, and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program under Grant No. RCYX20200-714114645048, No. JCYJ20190808142207420, and No. GJHZ2-0190822095416463.; Funding text 2: In our experiments, we used the NSGA-II [42], NSGA-III [43], and MOPSO [44] algorithms.

Instead of fully avoiding flood-prone areas, an optimized placement considering the magnitude of flood inundations can minimize the impact of flood hazards and simultaneously maximize the socio-economic benefit of EV charging station networks. In this study, an integrated framework of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is proposed to optimize the charging station locations by maximizing the charging convenience, minimizing the impact of flood hazards, and minimizing the impact of existing charging stations. The NSGA-III is applied to solve the multi-objective location optimization of charging stations. TOPSIS is subsequently used to determine the best solution from the feasible candidates generated by the NSGA-III. A case study conducted in the Waikiki area demonstrates that the proposed optimization framework can effectively deal with the trade-off between the impact of flood hazards and the charging service of a charging station network.

Evolutionary techniques for multi-objective optimization are becoming popular among different fields, due to their effectiveness in obtaining a set of trade-off solutions. In contrast to some conventional methods, that aggregate the objectives into one weighted-sum objective function, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms manage to find a set of solutions in the Pareto-optimal front. Selecting one algorithm, however, for a specific problem adds additional challenge. In this paper the ground station scheduling problem was solved through six different evolutionary multi-objective algorithms, the NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA2, GDE3, IBEA, and MOEA/D. The goal is to test their efficacy and performance to a number of benchmark static instances of the ground scheduling problem. Benchmark instances are of different sizes, allowing further testing of the behavior of the algorithms to different dimensionality of the problem. The solutions are compared to the recent solutions of a weighted-sum approach solved by the GA. The results show that all multi-objective algorithms manage to find as good solution as the weighted-sum, while giving more additional alternatives. The decomposition-based MOEA/D outperforms the rest of the algorithms for the specific problem in almost all aspects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary optimization; Multi-objective approach; Satellite scheduling","Benchmarking; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Pareto principle; Satellite ground stations; Satellites; Scheduling; Evolutionary optimizations; Ground station scheduling; Multi objective; Multi-objective approach; Objective approaches; Optimization of communications; Satellite scheduling; Scheduling problem; Specific problems; Weighted Sum; Multiobjective optimization","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Slovenian Research Agency (research core funding No. P2-0098).

The dataset can contain records running into hundreds of thousands and even millions of relevant, irrelevant and redundant features. Therefore, feature selection to select only the significant features for developing vehicle collision detection alarm systems for deployment in the IoV edge is critical. However, previous studies on vehicle collision detection in the IoV have not conducted rigorous feature selection. Limited studies have mainly applied Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to select subset features influencing vehicle collision in the domain of IoV. However, PCC can cause relevant features to be discarded if the correlation of the non-linear association is too small, thereby providing incorrect feature ranking, which, in turn, increases the chances of developing a model that will give a poor outcome. To close this gap, this paper proposed a multi-objective, filter-based hybrid non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm III with a gain ratio and bi-directional wrapper for the selection of subset features influencing vehicle collision in the IoV. The proposed approach selected the minimal most significant subset features for developing a vehicle collision detection classifier with maximum accuracy for deployment in the IoV. A comparative study proves that the proposed approach performs better than the compared algorithms across hybrid-, wrapper- and filter-based feature selection methods within the family of the NSGA. Further, a comparative analysis with other evolutionary algorithms proves the superiority of the proposal. This study can help researchers in the future by avoiding the use of large-scale computing resources in acquiring data to develop vehicle collision alert systems in the IoV. This can be achieved since only the subset features discovered in this study are collected, as opposed to collecting large features, thus saving time and resources in the subsequent vehicle collision detection data collection in the IoV. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","feature selection; filter; gain ratio; Internet of Vehicles; multi-objective NSGA III; sensors; vehicle collision detection; wrapper","","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Deanship of Scientific Research of the University of Hafr Al Batin (UHB), Hafr Al Batin, Saudi Arabia through Research Grant no.

Protecting the IoT-Fog resources and the scheduling services from the treats is critical for executing the users’ requests in the IoT-Fog network. Proper scheduling algorithms are essential to fulfill the requirements of users’ applications properly and fully harness the potential of IoT-Fog resources. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a structure that decouples the control plane from the data plane, resulting in more flexible management. That eases the implementation of security mechanisms in the IoT-Fog networks. In SDN-based IoT-Fog networks, SDN switches and controllers can serve as fog gateways/cloud gateways. SDN switches and controllers, on the other hand, are more susceptible to a variety of assaults, making the SDN controller a bottleneck and thus easy to control plane saturation. IoT devices are inherently insecure, making the IoT-Fog network vulnerable to a variety of attacks. This paper presents S-FoS, an SDN-based security-aware workflow scheduler for IoT-Fog networks. The proposed approach defends scheduling services against distributed denial of service (DDoS) and port scanning assaults. S-FoS is a joint security and performance optimization approach that uses fuzzy-based anomaly detection algorithms to identify the source of attacks and block malicious requestors. It also uses a NSGA-III multi-objective scheduler optimization approach to consider load balancing and delay simultaneously. We show that the S-FoS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in IoT-based scenarios through comprehensive simulations. The experiments indicate that by varying the attack rates, the number of IoT devices, and the number of fog devices, the response time of S-FoS could be improved by 31% and 18%, and the network utilization of S-FoS could be improved by 9% and 4%, respectively, compared to the NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fuzzy logic; IoT-Fog networks; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Software-Defined Networking(SDN)","Anomaly detection; Controllers; Denial-of-service attack; Fog computing; Fuzzy logic; Gateways (computer networks); Information management; Internet of things; Multiobjective optimization; Network security; Scheduling algorithms; Software defined networking; Control planes; Fuzzy-Logic; Internet of thing-fog network; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-III; Optimization approach; Performance optimizations; Scheduling service; Software-defined networkings; Workflow scheduling; Fog","","","This work is partially funded by “Centro Nazionale HPC, Big Data e Quantum Computing – Italian Center for Super Computing (ICSC)” – Codice progetto MUR: CN_00000013 – CUP Unina: E63C22000980007.","Elazhary, Hanan H., Internet of Things (IoT), mobile cloud, cloudlet, mobile IoT, IoT cloud, fog, mobile edge, and edge emerging computing paradigms: Disambiguation and research directions, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 128, pp. 105-140, (2019); IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, (2019); IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, (2019); IEEE Internet of Things Journal, (2021); Gupta, Sejal, Energy-efficient dynamic homomorphic security scheme for fog computing in IoT networks, Journal of Information Security and Applications, 58, (2021); Neshenko, Nataliia, Demystifying IoT Security: An Exhaustive Survey on IoT Vulnerabilities and a First Empirical Look on Internet-Scale IoT Exploitations, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 3, pp. 2702-2733, (2019); Dainotti, Alberto, A cascade architecture for DoS attacks detection based on the wavelet transform, Journal of Computer Security, 17, 6, pp. 945-968, (2009); Nascita, Alfredo, Machine and Deep Learning Approaches for IoT Attack Classification, (2022); Sharma, Shivi, Fog assisted task allocation and secure deduplication using 2FBO2 and MoWo in cluster-based industrial IoT (IIoT), Computer Communications, 152, pp. 187-199, (2020); Vishwakarma, Ruchi, A survey of DDoS attacking techniques and defence mechanisms in the IoT network, Telecommunication Systems, 73, 1, pp. 3-25, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22142134; 22142126","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144458092"

The objective of PRHD is to predict the structural and functional characteristics of un-annotated protein sequences by means of homologies. Two sequences are said to be homologous if there exists a shared ancestry between them. It aims to detect the evolutionary relationships among protein sequences, that are distantly located, via computational techniques. Prediction of functions of protein sequences are computationally intensive. Features extracted from protein sequences are too high and presence of insignificant redundant features degrades the performance of computational model with respect to time and cost. Hence, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA, the high dimensional input matrix was transformed into a lower dimension matrix. In the first stage, for each protein sequence, 531 physico-chemical properties from AAIndex database are considered as features for homology detection. The protein sequences are taken from protein families from UniProtKB database. A set of 185 representative features have been extracted from 531 features using PCA. In the second stage, NSGA II and NSGA III, two powerful optimization techniques are used to efficiently search the non-zero eigen space and retrieve distinguishable eigen vectors. This work is tested on widely used Uniprot and SCOP benchmark datasets. To check the efficiency of both the algorithms, the controlling parameters are kept same and numerical simulations were performed.

Temperature plays a vital role in HS being used for two distinct procedures; Sorting and Crossover. In sorting, temperature is combined with the niche distance to determine the rank order of a population front. In crossover, the temperature of two population members are compared to determine the quantity of information to take from each parent. HS is a new optimisation algorithm capable of solving constrained real-world problems. This paper will present the HS application to a real-world capacity planning problem involving networking infrastructure. To proof the algorithm applicability to wider set of problems, we will report the HS results over a subset of the constrained multi objective problems used for optimisation competitions by the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEEC). In these problems we have compared to the popular NSGA-II and its successor NSGA-III.

However, previous studies on the scheduling and optimization of railway track maintenance plans possess the following limitations. First, scheduling optimization models generally operate at the planning level with months as the time units rather than at the operation scheduling level with days as the time units. Second, they fail to consider the bidirectional feedback and dynamic impact between predicted condition and maintenance scheduling. Third, actual on-site operation strategies (e.g., opportunistic and centralized maintenance) are neglected. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel operation-level maintenance scheduling framework based on segment condition considering both opportunistic and centralized maintenance strategies. According to the problem characteristics, ae hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm based on a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization was designed. Furthermore, by utilizing actual practical cases, the effectiveness of the model and algorithm was verified via comparison with MOPSO, NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and Gurobi in different scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Condition based maintenance; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Planning; Railroad tracks; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Scheduled maintenance; Centralised; Condition; Maintenance plans; Maintenance schedules; Maintenance scheduling; Railway track; Schedule optimizations; Time units; Track maintenance; Train operations; Scheduling; algorithm; comparative study; maintenance; model test; optimization; planning process; railway transport; transportation safety","","","","Adeli, Hojjat, Augmented lagrangian genetic algorithm for structural optimization, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 104-118, (1994); Adeli, Hojjat, Integrated genetic algorithm for optimization of space structures, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 6, 4, pp. 315-328, (1993); Adeli, Hojjat, Concurrent genetic algorithms for optimization of large structures, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 7, 3, pp. 276-296, (1994); Adeli, Hojjat, Distributed genetic algorithm for structural optimization, Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 8, 3, pp. 156-163, (1995); Adeli, Hojjat, Cost Optimization of Structures: Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, and Parallel Computing, pp. 1-203, (2006); Ai, Chengbo, A Nonballasted Rail Track Slab Crack Identification Method Using a Level-Set-Based Active Contour Model, Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 33, 7, pp. 571-584, (2018); Allah Bukhsh, Zaharah, Predictive maintenance using tree-based classification techniques: A case of railway switches, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 101, pp. 35-54, (2019); Almgren, Torgny, The opportunistic replacement problem: Theoretical analyses and numerical tests, Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 76, 3, pp. 289-319, (2012); An, Ru, Improved railway track geometry degradation modeling for tamping cycle prediction, Journal of Transportation Engineering Part A: Systems, 144, 7, (2018); Andrade, A.

The existing methods of cloudlet-based computing optimization are numerous.

To achieve high-efficiency and low-loss defensive operations, a reasonable air defense weapon assignment strategy is a key step. In this paper, a multi-objective and multi-constraints weapon target assignment (WTA) model is established that aims to minimize the defensive resource loss, minimize total weapon consumption, and minimize the target residual effectiveness. An optimization framework of air defense weapon mission scheduling based on the multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) algorithm is proposed. The solution for point-to-point saturated attack targets at different operational scales is achieved by encoding the nectar with real numbers. Simulations are performed for an imagined air defense scenario, where air defense weapons are saturated. The non-dominated solution sets are obtained by the MOABC algorithm to meet the operational demand. In the case where there are more weapons than targets, more diverse assignment schemes can be selected. According to the inverse generation distance (IGD) index, the convergence and diversity for the solutions of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) algorithm and the MOABC algorithm are compared and analyzed. The results prove that the MOABC algorithm has better convergence and the solutions are more evenly distributed among the solution space. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","air defense; defensive resource loss; multi-objective artificial bee colony; target residual effectiveness; total weapon consumption; Weapon target assignment","Genetic algorithms; Military rockets; Air defense weapons; Air-defence; Bee colony algorithms; Combat equipment; Defensive resource loss; Equipment technology; Multi-objective artificial bee colonies; Target residual effectiveness; Total weapon consumption; Weapon-target assignment; Network security","","","Funding Statement: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71771216).","Lu, Yiping, A new exact algorithm for the Weapon-Target Assignment problem, Omega (United Kingdom), 98, (2021); Shojaeifard, Ali Reza, Projection Recurrent Neural Network Model: A New Strategy to Solve Weapon-Target Assignment Problem, Neural Processing Letters, 50, 3, pp. 3045-3057, (2019); Fire Control Command Control, (2003); Davis, Michael T., Approximate dynamic programming for missile defense interceptor fire control, European Journal of Operational Research, 259, 3, pp. 873-886, (2017); Nie, Junfeng, Modeling and Optimization of Weapon-target Assignment for Group Targets Defense Based on NSGA-Ⅲ Algorithm, Binggong Xuebao/Acta Armamentarii, 42, 8, pp. 1771-1779, (2021); Fire Control Command Control, (2016); Li, You, A Modified Pareto Ant Colony Optimization Approach to Solve Biobjective Weapon-Target Assignment Problem, International Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 2017, (2017); Lee, Zne Jung, Efficiently solving general weapon-target assignment problem by genetic algorithms with greedy eugenics, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 33, 1, pp. 113-121, (2003); Fan, Chengli, Weapon-target allocation optimization algorithm based on IDPSO, Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics, 37, 2, pp. 336-342, (2015); Zhou, Jing, Many-objective task allocation method based on D-NSGA-III algorithm for multi-UAVs, Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics, 43, 5, pp. 1240-1247, (2021)","","Tech Science Press","","","","","","15462218; 15462226","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174387175"

To make appropriate load-balancing decisions, the influential Quality of Service (QoS) parameters should be identified. Most load-balancing techniques have focused on optimizing the multi-objective QoS while, the QoS optimization from the user, service provider and infrastructure provider directions simultaneously is an important many-objective problem. Extracting the QoS parameters from various directions, this paper proposes a tolerable many-objective load-balancing technique to efficiently allocate computing resources to workflows. Cost, response time, energy consumption, and CPU utilization have been investigated as the user, service provider, and infrastructure's QoS parameters solved by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. Also, a load-tolerance concept has been introduced to improve the QoS-based load balancing and task acceptance rate together.

In this task, one primary VM resides on a physical machine (PM) and one or more replicas reside on separate PMs. In cloud computing, VM placement (VMP) is a well-studied problem in terms of different goals, such as power consumption reduction. The VMP problem can be solved by using heuristics, namely, first-fit and meta-heuristics such as the genetic algorithm. Despite extensive research into the VMP problem, there are few works that consider VM replication when choosing a VMP. In this context, we proposed studying the problem of optimal VMP considering VM replication requirements. The proposed work frames the problem at hand as a multiobjective problem and adapts a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to address the problem. VM replicas' placement should consider several dimensions such as the geographical distance between the PM hosting the primary VM and the other PMs hosting the replicas. In addition, to this end, the proposed model aims to minimize (1) power consumption, (2) performance degradation, and (3) the distance between the PMs hosting the primary VM and its replica(s). The proposed method is thoroughly tested on a variety of computing environments with various heterogeneous VMs and PMs, including compute-intensive and memory-intensive environments.

The cubic spline algorithm, fifth-order polynomial interpolation algorithm, a fusing cubic spline and fifth-order polynomial algorithm aim to shorten harvesting time, reduce jerk and enhance the robustness of the harvesting manipulator, respectively. Then the trajectory planning problem is converted into a multi-objective optimization solution problem. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-the third version (NSGA-III) technology is used to address multi-objective optimization constrained problems with time, energy consumption and jerk optimization objectives. The Pareto optimal set containing the multiple constraints is obtained through the NSGA-III algorithm. Compared to a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-the second version (NSGA-II) technique, optimal solution with a shorter time is chosen from the non-dominated Pareto optimal set and sent to the manipulator controller actuator. Under the robot operating system (ROS), the cubic spline algorithm, fifth-order polynomial interpolation algorithm, a fusing cubic spline and fifth-order polynomial algorithm with the structural coefficient obtained respectively through NSGA-III algorithm and NSGA-II algorithm are simulated. The simulation results show that the NSGA-III algorithm has a better result in addressing the trajectory planning problem. The experimental analysis of the harvesting manipulator verifies the proposed scheme that the cubic spline algorithm based on the NSGA-III algorithm enables the harvesting manipulator to track the picking path faster and smoother, which is effective and feasible for reducing the time and improving the harvesting efficiency of kiwifruit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cubic spline algorithm; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III algorithm; Trajectory planning","Agricultural robots; Constrained optimization; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Harvesting; Interpolation; Manipulators; Motion planning; Pareto principle; Robot programming; Trajectories; Cubic spline; Cubic spline algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-III algorithm; Optimisations; Pareto-optimization; Spline (mathematic); Splines (mathematics); Trajectory Planning; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported in part by the Innovation Project of Guilin University of Electronic Technology (GUET) Graduate Education under Grant 2022YCXS152, in part by the Young and Middle-Aged Promoting Scientific Research Ability Project of Guangxi under Grant 2019KY0225, in part by the Key Laboratory of Automatic Testing Technology and Instruments Foundation of Guangxi under Grant YQ19107, in part by the Key Research and Development Projects in Guangxi under Grant AB21076005, and in part by the Specialized Talents in Guangxi under Grant AD18281018.","Liu, Zhihao, Improved Kiwifruit Detection Using Pre-Trained VGG16 with RGB and NIR Information Fusion, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 2327-2336, (2020); Williams, Henry A.M., Robotic kiwifruit harvesting using machine vision, convolutional neural networks, and robotic arms, Biosystems Engineering, 181, pp. 140-156, (2019); Barnett, Josh J., Work distribution of multiple Cartesian robot arms for kiwifruit harvesting, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 169, (2020); Mu, Longtao, Design and simulation of an integrated end-effector for picking kiwifruit by robot, Information Processing in Agriculture, 7, 1, pp. 58-71, (2020); Barnett, Eric, A Bisection Algorithm for Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning along Fully Specified Paths, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 37, 1, pp. 131-145, (2021); Wang, Wenjie, Robot Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning Based on Improved Cuckoo Search Algorithm, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 86923-86933, (2020); Dai, Chengkai, Planning Jerk-Optimized Trajectory with Discrete Time Constraints for Redundant Robots, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 17, 4, pp. 1711-1724, (2020); Jin, Rongyu, Cartesian trajectory planning of space robots using a multi-objective optimization, Aerospace Science and Technology, 108, (2021); Tang, Yongxing, A tutorial and review on robot motion planning, Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, 44, 2, (2023); Bai, Yunfei, Trajectory Planning of Deep-sea Electric Manipulator Based on Energy Optimization, Jiqiren/Robot, 42, 3, pp. 301-308, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163477368"

Several advanced versions of SMA have been proposed. However, most existing methods primarily focus on the single-objective research domain, leaving the research on multi-objective SMA relatively limited. Additionally, the basic SMA lacks robust global search capability, and extending it to the multi-objective domain often results in a loss of solution diversity. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a general multi-objective SMA framework. It incorporates a logical chaotic single-dimensional perturbation mechanism to enhance individuals' search traversal in the decision space. Furthermore, a non-dominated sorting mechanism based on the reference point is employed to select a more diverse set of solutions for the subsequent evolution of the next generation. Through experiments conducted on 28 basis functions using seven advanced multi-objective algorithms (CMOPSO, NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEAD, PSEA-II, SPEA-II, and NSLS), the results demonstrate that the multi-objective SMA outperforms other algorithms in terms of convergence, accuracy, and diversity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","a logical chaotic single-dimensional perturbation; multi-objective; reference point; Slime mould algorithm","Behavioral research; Evolutionary algorithms; Molds; Multiobjective optimization; A logical chaotic single-dimensional perturbation; Behavioral science; Chaotics; Convergence; Iterative algorithm; Multi objective; Optimisations; Reference points; Slime mold algorithm; Slime moulds; Iterative methods","","","","Communications of the ACM, (2003); Bui, Quangthanh, Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping, Journal of Hydrology, 581, (2020); Fadaee Nejad, Mohsen, Multi-objective optimization of a stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system by using evolutionary algorithms: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 16, 5, pp. 3364-3369, (2012); Mayer, Martin János, Environmental and economic multi-objective optimization of a household level hybrid renewable energy system by genetic algorithm, Applied Energy, 269, (2020); Cai, Xuebing, Joint optimal multi-connectivity enabled user association and power allocation in mmWave networks, IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC, 2021-March, (2021); Lu, Zhichao, NSGA-Net: Neural architecture search using multi-objective genetic algorithm, pp. 419-427, (2019); Joint User Association and Power Allocation in Ultra Dense Mmwave Networks A Multi Connectivity Approach, (2022); Genetic Algorithms the Design of Innovation, (2010); Cui, Yunfei, Review: Multi-objective optimization methods and application in energy saving, Energy, 125, pp. 681-704, (2017); Zhang, Xingyi, A competitive mechanism based multi-objective particle swarm optimizer with fast convergence, Information Sciences, 427, pp. 63-76, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161019619"

Meanwhile, more than three objectives are usually considered simultaneously during this process. Therefore, it is a typical many-objective optimization problem that is NP-hard. Most existing many-objective optimization algorithms cannot preserve extreme solutions due to the failure of Pareto dominance. In this paper, through introducing the idea of S-CDAS into the traditional NSGA-III, an improved many-objective evolutionary algorithm named NSGA-III for extreme solutions preservation (ESP-NSGA-III) is proposed with problem-specific genetic operations to generate regional coverage schemes. A comparative study is conducted with other six state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms. Hypervolume (HV) and pure diversity (PD) metrics are used to evaluate the performance of algorithms. The simulation results show that ESP-NSGA-III has good comprehensive performance and improves the diversity of original algorithms. The maximum difference of the coverage rate between ESP-NSGA-III and other six algorithms is 0.2576 so that satisfactory regional coverage scheme can be obtained by ESP-NSGA-III.

A novel optimal capacitor planning (OCP) procedure is proposed for large-scale utility power distribution systems, which is exemplified on an existing utility circuit of approximately 4,000 buses. An initial sensitivity analysis is employed to intelligently reduce OCP computation time and maintain quality of optimal configurations. Three optimization objectives are considered, including the minimization of total system active power losses, standard deviation of node voltages, and investment in total capacitor power rating. Eight multi-objective optimization methods that employ the non-dominated sorting algorithm III (NSGA-III) concept are compared to determine individual merits. Differences between the methods include the incorporation of a penalty constraint for voltage violations and the automatic readjustment of load-tap-changing (LTC) transformer tap settings for proposed capacitor re-configurations concurrently within the optimizer, which ensures peak system performance and fair comparison to the reference case. A multi-step model conversion process was developed with OpenDSS to enable the OCP procedure to be generally applicable to real large-scale utility circuits. OCP is performed for three example sub-circuits served by a substation with a 48MW, 9Mvar peak load, which represents the most extreme case and offers the best opportunity for savings. Example configurations from the resulting Pareto sets through a pseudo-weight vector approach are also analyzed through a systematic procedure of comparison between the most extreme configuration types to inform configuration selection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capacitor; control; differential evolution; load-tap-changing transformers; non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; openDSS; optimization; power distribution systems; sensitivity analysis","Circuit simulation; Cost effectiveness; Electric loads; Genetic algorithms; Integrated circuits; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Power quality; Quality control; Reactive power; Timing circuits; Differential Evolution; Integrated circuit modeling; Load modeling; Load tap changing transformers; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Onload tap changer; OpenDSS; Optimisations; Power distributions; Power-distribution system; Transformer; Sensitivity analysis","","","This research was funded in part by the Department of Education's Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) Fellowship Program through the University of Kentucky Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU), part of the PPL Corporation family of companies.","Optimal Capacitor Placement Costs Benefits Due to Loss Reductions, (2023); Chiang, Hsiaodong, Optimal Capacitor Placements in Distribution Systems: Part 1: A New Formulation and the Overall Problem, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 5, 2, pp. 634-642, (1990); Noori, Alireza, Hybrid allocation of capacitor and distributed static compensator in radial distribution networks using multi-objective improved golden ratio optimization based on fuzzy decision making, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 162180-162195, (2020); Ahmadi, Mikaeel, Multi-objective time-variant optimum automatic and fixed type of capacitor bank allocation considering minimization of switching steps, AIMS Energy, 7, 6, pp. 792-818, (2019); Onaka, Jose Henrique Dias, Optimal capacitor banks placement in distribution grids using NSGA II and Harmonic Resonance Chart, Proceedings of International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power, ICHQP, 2016-December, pp. 89-94, (2016); Eajal, Abdelsalam A., Optimal capacitor placement and sizing in unbalanced distribution systems with harmonics consideration using particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 25, 3, pp. 1734-1741, (2010); Chang, Chungfu, Reconfiguration and capacitor placement for loss reduction of distribution systems by ant colony search algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 23, 4, pp. 1747-1755, (2008); Huang, Shyh-Jier Jier, A plant growth-based optimization approach applied to capacitor placement in power systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 27, 4, pp. 2138-2145, (2012); Ganguly, Sanjib, Multi-objective planning of electrical distribution systems incorporating shunt capacitor banks, pp. 436-441, (2011); Krami, Nissrine, Pareto multiobjective optimization technique for reactive power planning, (2008)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149409023"

To alleviate the above challenges, we proposed a dual-population-based NSGA-III, named DP-NSGA-III, where the two populations exchange information through the offspring. The main population based on the NSGA-III solves CMaOPs and the auxiliary populations with different environment selection ignore the constraints. In addition, we designed an (Formula presented.) -constraint handling method in combination with NSGA-III, aiming to exploit the excellent infeasible solutions in the main population. The proposed DP-NSGA-III is compared with four state-of-the-art CMaOEAs on a series of benchmark problems. The experimental results show that the proposed evolutionary algorithm is highly competitive in solving CMaOPs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","coevolution; constrained many-objective optimization; dual-population; evolutionary algorithm; ε-constraint handling","","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51977100.","Mala-Jetmarova, Helena, Lost in optimisation of water distribution systems?

This paper first proposes a dynamic dense traffic flow model under the condition of fading channel. Based on this, the reliability is redefined according to the real-time location information of vehicles. The on-board units (OBU) migrate intensive computing tasks to the appropriate RSU to optimize the execution time and calculating cost at the same time. In addition, competitive delay is introduced into the model of execution time, which can describe the channel resource contention and data conflict in dynamic scenes of the internet of vehicles (IoV). Next, the task scheduling for RSU is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. In order to solve the problem, a task scheduling algorithm based on a reliability constraint (TSARC) is proposed to select the optimal RSU for task transmission. When compared with the genetic algorithm (GA), there are some improvements of TSARC: first, the quick non-dominated sorting is applied to layer the population and reduce the complexity. Second, the elite strategy is introduced with an excellent nonlinear optimization ability, which ensures the diversity of optimal individuals and provides different preference choices for passengers. Third, the reference point mechanism is introduced to reserve the individuals that are non-dominated and close to reference points. TSARC’s Pareto based multi-objective optimization can comprehensively measure the overall state of the system and flexibly schedule system resources. Furthermore, it overcomes the defects of the GA method, such as the determination of the linear weight value, the non-uniformity of dimensions among objectives, and poor robustness. Finally, numerical simulation results based on the British Highway Traffic Flow Data Set show that the TSARC performs better scalability and efficiency than other methods with different numbers of tasks and traffic flow densities, which verifies the previous theoretical derivation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","channel occlusion; internet of vehicles; mobile edge computing; non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; task scheduling; vehicle-to-infrastructure","","","","This research was funded by the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (No. 18510745100).","Mu, Liting, Multi-Task Offloading Based on Optimal Stopping Theory in Edge Computing Empowered Internet of Vehicles, Entropy, 24, 6, (2022); Hou, Yanzhao, Joint allocation of wireless resource and computing capability in MEC-enabled vehicular network, China Communications, 18, 6, pp. 64-76, (2021); Hoque, Mohammad Asadul, The extent of reliability for vehicle-to-vehicle communication in safety critical applications: an experimental study, Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems: Technology, Planning, and Operations, 24, 3, pp. 264-278, (2020); Selvakumari, P.

A multi-objective combined optimization intelligent scheduling model of harvesters and grain transport vehicles was established to save agricultural machinery resources, and improve the overall efficiency of harvesters and transport vehicles, to meet the constraints of plot location, task number, operation time window, and path planning. The model was solved by an intelligent search algorithm, and an intelligent scheduling method of command multi-machine cooperative operation based on NSGA-III and an improved ant colony algorithm was proposed. When the harvester is full loaded, there is non harvest area on one side of the grain unloading cylinder, there the grain truck can not reach and unload cooperatively. To solve this problem, the prediction method of early unloading point was designed and further improved by determining the workload constraints and time constraints. When solving the model, the reference point setting in NSGA-III can ensure the diversity of the population. And then the ant colony algorithm that sets the detour vertex instead of the grid map is used to solve the optimal command call time and the optimal unloading position, and then the dynamic time window and the local dynamic obstacle avoidance path of the transport machine are divided. Finally, the designed model can output an accurate scheduling planning scheme with deployment information. It can be seen from the simulation test that the scheduling model established, and the solution algorithm designed in this research can obtain many groups of good optimization results. Moreover, it can make the unproductive waiting time of harvester 0, and minimize the transfer distance and number of grain transporters. This method can be combined closely with the practical application of unmanned farms, which lays a theoretical foundation for improving the efficiency of multi-machine cooperative operations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ant colony algorithm; Multi-machine cooperative operation; Multi-objective combinatorial optimization; NSGA-III; Scheduling planning model","Ant colony optimization; Combinatorial optimization; Efficiency; Grain (agricultural product); Harvesting; Motion planning; Multiobjective optimization; Trucks; Unloading; Ant colonies algorithm; Cooperative operation; Intelligent scheduling; Multi-machine cooperative operation; Multi-machines; Multiobjective combinatorial optimization; NSGA-III; Planning models; Scheduling methods; Scheduling planning model; Harvesters; algorithm; detection method; machinery; model; optimization; simulation","","","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFD2000600-2021YFD2000604 & 2022YFD2001600-2022YFD2001601).","Journal of China Agricultural University, (2019); Cao, Ruyue, Multi-machine Cooperation Task Planning Based on Ant Colony Algorithm, Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 50, pp. 34-39, (2019); Cao, Ruyue, Task assignment of multiple agricultural machinery cooperation based on improved ant colony algorithm, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 182, (2021); Cao, Ruyue, Multi-machine Cooperation Global Path Planning Based on A-star Algorithm and Bezier Curve, Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 52, pp. 548-554, (2021); undefined, (2016); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Huang, Huang, Multi-site and multi-machine cooperative instant response scheduling system based on fuzzy membership, Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 37, 21, pp. 71-79, (2021); Jensen, Martin Andreas Falk, In-field and inter-field path planning for agricultural transport units, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 63, 4, pp. 1054-1061, (2012); undefined, (2001); Li, Shichao, Development of a following agricultural machinery automatic navigation system, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 158, pp. 335-344, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145548482"

However, the preference of each tourist may be different. Some tourists prefer to optimize a single criterion, while others prefer to optimize conflicting multiple-criteria. The tourism service provider can hardly offer the tourists with the itinerary according to their precise preferences. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization framework based on which tourists can generate itineraries according to their preferences. A mathematical model is presented, which is multi-objective and NP-hard. Consequently, four meta-heuristic algorithms, namely none-dominated sorting genetic algorithm versions II (NSGA-II) and III (NSGA-III), multi objective grey wolf optimization, and multi objective imperialist competitive algorithm are developed. The proposed method helps the tourists to compare different combinations of activities and select the one that best suits their preferences. The model is tested on a small-scale real case pertaining to the Sultanat of Oman. Thereafter, the performances of the proposed algorithms were evaluated on large scale problems. The result shows that NSGAs outperformed other algorithms. NSGA-II outperformed its NSGA-III counterpart in small instances. Surprisingly, as the size of the problem increases, the efficiency of NSGA-II decreases while that of NSGA-III increases. In large instances, NSGA-III outperformed NSGA-II. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Meta-heuristic algorithms; Multi-objective optimization; Tourism industry; Tourist preferences","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Supply chains; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiple criteria; Optimization models; Personalized tourisms; Sorting genetic algorithm; Tourism industry; Tourism supply chain; Tourist preference; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Atashpaz-Gargari, Esmaeil, Imperialist competitive algorithm: An algorithm for optimization inspired by imperialistic competition, pp. 4661-4667, (2007); Brito Santana, Julio J., A fuzzy GRASP algorithm for solving a Tourist Trip Design Problem, IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, (2017); Campbell, Ann Melissa, The orienteering problem with stochastic travel and service times, Annals of Operations Research, 186, 1, pp. 61-81, (2011); International Journal of Computers, (2011); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1917, pp. 849-858, (2000); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); De Falco, Ivanoe, Optimizing Personalized Touristic Itineraries by a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm, International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, 15, 6, pp. 1269-1312, (2016); Expositó-Márquez, Airam, A fuzzy GRASP for the tourist trip design with clustered POIs, Expert Systems with Applications, 127, pp. 210-227, (2019); Gavalas, Damianos, The eCOMPASS multimodal tourist tour planner, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 21, pp. 7303-7316, (2015); Golden, Bruce L., The orienteering problem, Naval Research Logistics, 34, 3, pp. 307-318, (1987)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143794228"

All the calculation cases are obtained using the optimal Latin hypercube sampling method. The numerical method and its settings are verified through full-scale tests. The established relationship model of the main aerodynamic parameters for the amplitude of the pressure wave outside the train is accurate; however, it is relatively poor for the change rate of the pressure wave inside the train for 3 s. Pareto solutions are obtained from multi-objective optimization with the NSGA-III algorithm, from which two combinations of aerodynamic parameters are randomly selected to establish a simulation model for the numerical calculation. The calculated data are compared and analyzed with the predicted results of the previous two combinations selected from the Pareto solutions, which show that the differences in the maximum values of the amplitude of the pressure wave outside the train and the change rate of the pressure wave inside the train in a time of 3 s between the calculation and prediction are less than 7.5% and 25%, respectively. The method proposed in this paper can be used to predict the redundant space of multiple parameters for railway train/tunnel systems for the airtight performance of trains deteriorated after long-term operation; it can also be used to evaluate the adaptability of high-speed trains on transnational railway lines with different parameters. At present, this method has a few shortcomings in terms of accuracy; however, it can aid in simplifying the analysis and calculation in engineering pre-design and in considerably reducing project investments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Airtightness performance; High-speed train; Multi-objective optimization; Pressure wave; Tunnel","Aerodynamics; Numerical methods; Parameter estimation; Railroad cars; Railroad transportation; Railroad tunnels; Railroads; Vehicle performance; Aerodynamic parameters; Airtightness; Airtightness performance; High speed trains; Matchings; Multi-objectives optimization; Pareto solution; Performance; Pressure waves; Railway train; Multiobjective optimization","","","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (51805453), Foundation of Maglev Technology Key Laboratory of Railway Industry, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (XJ2021KJZK010) and Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control (20191104).","Aoki, Toshiyuki, Passive alleviation of micro-pressure waves from tunnel portals, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 220, 5, pp. 921-940, (1999); Baker, C.

Many studies have been developed to treat the inconsistency problem, but few of them tried to satisfy different quality measures, which are minimum inconsistency ((Formula presented.)), the total number of adjusted pairwise comparisons ((Formula presented.)), original rank preservation ((Formula presented.)), minimum average weights adjustment ((Formula presented.)) and finally, minimum L1 matrix norm between the original PCM and the adjusted PCM ((Formula presented.)). Design/methodology/approach: The approach is defined in four steps: first, the decision-maker should choose which quality measures she/he wishes to use, ranging from one to all quality measures. In the second step, the authors encode the PCM to be used in a many-objective optimization algorithm (MOOA), and each pairwise comparison can be adjusted individually. The authors generate consistent solutions from the obtained Pareto optimal front that carry the desired quality measures in the third step. Lastly, the decision-maker selects the most suitable solution for her/his problem. Remarkably, as the decision-maker can choose one (mono-objective), two (multi-objective), three or more (many-objectives) quality measures, not all MOOAs can handle or perform well in mono- or multi-objective problems. The unified non-sorting algorithm III (U-NSGA III) is the most appropriate MOOA for this type of scenario because it was specially designed to handle mono-, multi- and many-objective problems. Findings: The use of two quality measures should not guarantee that the adjusted PCM is similar to the original PCM; hence, the decision-maker should consider using more quality measures if the objective is to preserve the original PCM characteristics. Originality/value: For the first time, a many-objective approach reduces the CR to consistent levels with the ability to consider one or more quality measures and allows the decision-maker to adjust each pairwise comparison individually. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytic hierarchy process; Inconsistency reduction; Many-objective optimization algorithm; U-NSGA III","Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Pareto principle; % reductions; Decision makers; Inconsistency reduction; Many-objective optimization algorithm; Many-objective optimizations; Optimization algorithms; Pairwise comparison matrixes; Quality measures; Sorting algorithm; Unified non-sorting algorithm III; Analytic hierarchy process","","","","Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics, (2007); Abel, Edward, Reducing inconsistency in pairwise comparisons using multi-objective evolutionary computing, pp. 80-85, (2013); Abel, Edward, Inconsistency reduction in decision making via multi-objective optimisation, European Journal of Operational Research, 267, 1, pp. 212-226, (2018); Aguarón, Juan, The geometric consistency index: Approximated thresholds, European Journal of Operational Research, 147, 1, pp. 137-145, (2003); Aguarón, Juan, Reducing inconsistency measured by the geometric consistency index in the analytic hierarchy process, European Journal of Operational Research, 288, 2, pp. 576-583, (2021); Alonso, José Antonio, Consistency in the analytic hierarchy process: A new approach, International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems, 14, 4, pp. 445-459, (2006); Bader, Johannes, HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 45-76, (2011); Beńitez, Julio, Balancing consistency and expert judgment in AHP, Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 54, 7-8, pp. 1785-1790, (2011); Beńitez, Julio, A simple formula to find the closest consistent matrix to a reciprocal matrix, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 38, 15-16, pp. 3968-3974, (2014); Bortot, Silvia, Inconsistency and non-additive capacities: The Analytic Hierarchy Process in the framework of Choquet integration, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 213, pp. 6-26, (2013)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","25149318; 25149288","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124764184"

An important aspect of production scheduling is the assignment of operators with specific human factors to activities in a manufacturing project. This assignment impacts the duration of the activities, the total wage cost of the project and even the energy consumption during production. With increasing concern regarding low-carbon production in manufacturing, the human factors of operators thus cannot be ignored in the decision-making process in production project scheduling. In this context, our study considers an extension of the well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem for manufacturing. This problem is represented as a bi-objective optimization problem with the conjoint objectives of minimizing the total cost of the project and its carbon footprint. Two variants of a genetic algorithm-based memetic algorithm (MA) are proposed to solve this problem and a set of artificial, realistic project instances are generated to evaluate the proposed solution procedure. Experimental results show that the proposed MA outperforms the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA-II and NSGA-III) and its enhanced approach (ENSGA-II) in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. The experiments are conducted on both real-life case study data from an MTO project in the furniture industry and a large set of artificial data instances. Our research allows project managers to select appropriate operators to execute activities based on human factors, wage and power consumption with the objectives of minimum total cost and carbon footprint. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon footprints; Human factors; Manufacturing; Multi-objective; Project scheduling","Carbon footprint; Computational efficiency; Costs; Emission control; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Human engineering; Manufacture; Production control; Production efficiency; Scheduling; Wages; Customized products; Engineer to orders; Make to order; Manufacturing; Manufacturing projects; Memetic algorithms; Multi objective; Ordering system; Production Planning; Project scheduling; Decision making","","","This work was supported by the Fonds of Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO) under Grant 12A4222N .","Rahman, Humyun Fuad, A genetic algorithm for permutation flow shop scheduling under make to stock production system, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 90, pp. 12-24, (2015); Lin, Jian, A genetic programming hyper-heuristic approach for the multi-skill resource constrained project scheduling problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 140, (2020); Oztemel, Ercan, Bees Algorithm for multi-mode, resource-constrained project scheduling in molding industry, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 112, pp. 187-196, (2017); Wang, Wei, Green port project scheduling with comprehensive efficiency consideration, Maritime Policy and Management, 46, 8, pp. 967-981, (2019); Int J Prod Res, (2020); Rahman, Humyun Fuad, Real-time order acceptance and scheduling problems in a flow shop environment using hybrid Ga-PSO algorithm, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 112742-112755, (2019); Gong, Guiliang, Energy-efficient flexible flow shop scheduling with worker flexibility, Expert Systems with Applications, 141, (2020); Blazewicz, Jacek, Scheduling subject to resource constraints: classification and complexity, Discrete Applied Mathematics, 5, 1, pp. 11-24, (1983); Kolisch, Rainer, Local search for nonpreemptive multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling, IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers), 29, 11, pp. 987-999, (1997); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15684946","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141928334"

In this paper, a multi-objective decision model for liner shipping is established to optimize ship route, speed and number of ships deployed based on the three objectives. Moreover, the above model also takes into consideration the three latest ship emission reduction policies, including Emission Control Area, the 2020 Sulfur Limit Order and maritime Carbon Emission Taxation regulations. To solve the multi-objective scheduling problem, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) algorithm based on a chaos mechanism is proposed to find the Pareto solutions. And then a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, the Hyperplane-based ranking method (HYRM) is developed to find the trade-off solution from the Pareto solutions. The proposed method was applied to two liner shipping service routes around southeast Asia and eastern United States, the results show that the proposed method can simultaneously reduce sailing costs, time and ship emission according to the users' preferences, and it can help shipping companies cope with fuel price fluctuations effectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chaos algorithm; Hyperplane-based ranking method; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Sailing cost, time and emissions","Cost reduction; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Genetic algorithms; Geometry; Scheduling; Ships; Taxation; Chaos algorithm; Hyperplane-based ranking method; Liner shipping; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Pareto solution; Ranking methods; Sailing cost, time and emission; Ship emissions; Multiobjective optimization","","","This research was supported by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (LR19F030002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (52172334 and 52131202), and Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang (2022C03027).","Arunkumar, R., Optimal crop plans for a multi-reservoir system having intra-basin water transfer using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms coupled with chaos, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 140, pp. 34-47, (2017); Avanzi, Daniel Da Silva, A framework for interoperability assessment in crisis management, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 5, pp. 26-38, (2017); de Carvalho, André Britto, Measuring the convergence and diversity of CDAS Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms: A study of many-objective problems, Neurocomputing, 75, 1, pp. 43-51, (2012); Cheaitou, Ali, Greening of maritime transportation: a multi-objective optimization approach, Annals of Operations Research, 273, 1-2, pp. 501-525, (2019); Chen, Dongsheng, High-spatiotemporal-resolution ship emission inventory of China based on AIS data in 2014, Science of the Total Environment, 609, pp. 776-787, (2017); Chen, Dongsheng, Contribution of ship emissions to the concentration of PM2.5: A comprehensive study using AIS data and WRF/Chem model in Bohai Rim Region, China, Science of the Total Environment, 610-611, pp. 1476-1486, (2018); Chen, Hao, A multi-objective optimization approach for the selection of overseas oil projects, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 151, (2021); Chen, Yong, Industrial information integration—A literature review 2006–2015, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 2, pp. 30-64, (2016); Chen, Yong, A survey on industrial information integration 2016–2019, Journal of Industrial Integration and Management, 5, 1, pp. 33-163, (2020); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141472356"

The algorithm uses differential evolution (DE) as an evolutionary mechanism and also employs a novel diversity maintenance (DM) technique to avoid trapping in local optima. For the purpose of validating the performance of DOCEA/D, it has been compared here with other contemporary many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) namely MOEA/D, NSGA-III and IBEA on three instances of VMP problem. The results on the different quality indicators clearly demonstrate the superiority of DOCEA/D over the counterpart approaches.

For this purpose, a two-stage co-evolution constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (TSC-CMOEA) is presented to solve constrained multi-objective optimization problems. This method divides the search process into two phases: in the first stage, the synchronous co-evolution is used, and the population corresponding to the help problem and the population corresponding to the raw problem cooperate with each other and share the offspring to produce better solutions, so as to quickly cross the infeasible region and approach the Pareto front; The second stage discards the help problem when it fails and maintains only the evolution of the main population to save computing resources and enhance convergence. The combination of synchronous co-evolution and staged strategy allows the population to traverse infeasible regions more efficiently and converge quickly to feasible and non-dominant regions. The test results on benchmark CMOPs show that the convergence and population distribution of TSC-CMOEA is significantly better than those of NSGA-II, NSGA-III, C-MOEA/D, PPS, ToP and CCMO. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coevolution; Constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Constraint handling technique; Multiobjective optimization","Constrained optimization; Constraint handling; Evolutionary algorithms; Co-evolution; Coevolution algorithms; Constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Constraint-handling techniques; Engineering applications; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiobjective optimization","","","The authors are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on improving this article.

A solution approach is to leverage cloud resources for storing blocks within the chain. The paper, therefore, proposes two solutions to this problem. The first being an improved hybrid architecture design which uses containerization to create a side chain on a fog node for the devices connected to it and an Advanced Time-variant Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (AT-MOPSO) for determining the optimal number of blocks that should be transferred to the cloud for storage. This algorithm uses time-variant weights for the velocity of the particle swarm optimization and the non-dominated sorting and mutation schemes from NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm was compared with results from the original MOPSO algorithm, the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-II), and the Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm with region-based selection (PESA-II), and NSGA-III. The proposed AT-MOPSO showed better results than the aforementioned MOPSO algorithms in cloud storage cost and query probability optimization. Importantly, AT-MOPSO achieved 52% energy efficiency compared to NSGA-III. To show how this algorithm can be applied to a real-world Blockchain system, the BISS industrial Blockchain architecture was adapted and modified to show how the AT-MOPSO can be used with existing Blockchain systems and the benefits it provides. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; Cloud storage; Internet of Things; Particle swarm optimization; Scalability","Blockchain; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Multiobjective optimization; Screening; Architecture designs; Block-chain; Cloud storages; Hybrid architectures; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms; Side-chains; Solution approach; Storage optimization; Storage requirements; Time variant; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","The authors are grateful to the TWAS-DFG Visiting Researcher Programme for providing and funding a collaborative environment between Offenburg University of Applied Sciences and KNUST to undertake this research.

However, it is difficult for original algorithms to maintain the diversity of solutions in the high-dimensional objective space. The NSGA-III algorithm is an advanced algorithm based on Pareto dominance. In the high-dimensional objective space, the diversity maintenance of this algorithm is obviously lacking. In order to enhance the diversity of algorithms in many-objective optimization problems, a new distance dominance relation is proposed in this paper. First, in order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm, the distance dominance relation calculates the distance from the candidate solution to the ideal point as the fitness value, and selects the candidate solution with good fitness value as the non-dominant solution. Then, in order to enhance the diversity of the algorithm, the distance dominance relation sets each candidate solution to have the same niche and ensures that only one optimal solution is retained in the same territory. Finally, the NSGA- III algorithm is improved based on the proposed distance dominance relation. On the DTLZ and MaF test problems with 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 objectives, the improved algorithm is compared with seven commonly used algorithms. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm is highly competitive and can significantly enhance the diversity of the algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Distance dominance relation; Diversity; Many-objective optimization; NSGA- III","Convergence; Distance dominance relation; Diversity; Dominance relation; Fitness values; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Many-objective optimizations; NSGA- III; Objective space; Optimization","","","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [No.52074205; No.51774228]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [No.51974223]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China [2020JC-44].","Complex Systems, (1995); undefined, (2011); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016); Complex Intell Syst, (2017); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998); Kangal Report 200001, (2000); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); undefined, (2006); Elarbi, Maha, A New Decomposition-Based NSGA-II for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 48, 7, pp. 1191-1210, (2018); undefined, (2002)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133712602"

Alternative solutions, such as scalarization-based and indicator-based approaches, have been proposed in the literature. However, Pareto dominance-based algorithms are still widely used. In this paper, we propose to redefine the calculation of Pareto-dominance. Instead of assigning solutions to non-dominated fronts, they are ranked according to the measure of dominating solutions referred to as k-Pareto optimality. In the case of probability measures, such re-definition results in an elegant and fast approximate procedure. Through experimental results on the many-objective (Formula presented.) knapsack problem, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach: (1) the approximate calculation procedure is much faster than the standard sorting by Pareto dominance; (2) it allows for achieving higher hypervolume values for both multi-objective (two objectives) and many-objective (25 objectives) optimization; (3) in the case of many-objective optimization, the increased ability to differentiate between solutions results in a better compared to NSGA-II and NSGA-III. Apart from the numerical improvements, the probabilistic procedure can be considered as a linear extension of multidimentional topological sorting.

Some realistic assumptions namely fuzzy processing times and due dates involving triangular possibility distributions, transportation times, availability constraints, modified position-based learning effects on processing times, and sum-of-processing-times based learning effects on duration of maintenance activities were considered to provide a more general and practical model for the JSSP. Based on the learning effects, processing times decrease as the machine performs an operation frequently and workers gain working skill and experience. In this paper, based on DeJong's learning effect, a novel and modified formulation is proposed for this effect. According to the above-mentioned assumptions, a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the JSSP is suggested. The proposed model is first converted into an auxiliary crisp model, given that the model is a possibilistic programming and is then solved by TH and ""-constraint methods in the case of small-sized instances. Finally, the results are compared. For medium- and large-sized instances, ve metaheuristic algorithms including Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III), Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm (PESA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-II), NSGA-II, and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) are utilized, and the results are finally compared in terms of three performance metrics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Availability constraints; Job shop scheduling problem; Learning effects; Transportation times","Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Learning systems; Availability constraints; Biobjective model; Fuzzy parameter; Job shop scheduling problems; Learning effects; Maintenance activity; Makespan; Maximum tardiness; Processing time; Transportation time; Preventive maintenance; algorithm; fuzzy mathematics; numerical model; parameter estimation","","","","Torabi, S.

With the advancement of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and big data, demands for cloud resources, particularly certain unclear and emergent resource demands, are fast increasing. Classical cloud resource allocation approaches do not assist the emergent mode in terms of ensuring resource allocation timeliness and optimization. The proposed method employs an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Quality of Service Aware Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-QoSGA) method for quickly determining the best VM for each job. This paper proposed an improved resource allocation optimization technique that takes into account the goals of reducing deployment costs, balancing the load, and increasing the Quality of Service performance. Cloud customers' main challenge is deciding the resources to use for the deployment of their applications without negotiating the Quality of Service requirements. The proposed algorithm takes into account ‘n’ Number of customers Quality of Service needs and resources allocated inside the limited cost constraints. The proposed approach's major goal is to reduce task computational time, cost, and energy consumption while maximizing meaningful resource use. Extensive studies show that the suggested method outperforms other similar scheduling techniques in terms of energy cost and has a better outcome in terms of total execution time which is reduced by 4%, 8%, and 11% when compared with RAA-PI-NSGAII, SFWOA,NSGA-III and makespan, degree of imbalance, and security value under high load conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ANFIS; Cloud Computing; deployment cost; GA; QoS; Resource Allocation; VM","","","","T.

However, how to reduce the load imbalance of edge computing server while ensuring that the task processing of intelligent transportation device takes less time consumption and energy consumption has become a challenge.

This paper studied the modeling and solving methods of the rotation and echelon usage problems of aircraft equipment measured by dual-life indexes, one of which cannot be controlled. In order to maximize the waste rate of the rotation quantity, echelon uniformity index, life matching index and life utilization index, a decision-making model of the equipment rotation and echelon usage problem under uncertainty was constructed, and an improved NSGA-III with a variable length chromosome was proposed. An improved segmented coding method and operators were proposed, and the repeated individual control mechanism was used to improve the population diversity.

Adopting a reasonable deployment strategy can improve the QoS of WSNs. In this paper, the problem regarding sensor node deployment for WSNs on three-dimensional (3D) terrain is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. The coverage rate of the WSNs, their unbalanced energy consumption, and the number of sensor nodes are used as fitness functions for the optimization problem. We propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based on a Voronoi diagram (VNSGA) for solving the wireless sensor network deployment issue and improving the QoS of WSNs on 3D terrain. The proposed algorithm applies the Voronoi diagram to obtain the node-sensing radius and communication radius, which are suitable for 3D terrain with respect to calculating the fitness function of the optimization problem. The Pareto optimal solution is obtained by retaining the solution close to the reference point. The experiments compare the proposed algorithm with the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Algorithm (MOPSO) and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) on two terrains with different ranges. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithm on both terrains with different range sizes.

The production of heterologous proteins is important in different fields, such as medicine, environmental biology, and agriculture. Protein encoding is a difficult task and can be defined as a many-objective optimization problem, where four objectives must be optimized concurrently: codon adaptation, guanine-cytosine content, difference between sequences, and avoidance of hairpin loops. These objectives are why we propose and describe a many-objective approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) for protein encoding. The proposed algorithm was designed to work with novel mutation operators that are problem-aware and consider the different optimization objectives. The results of the proposed algorithm were compared to those of different tools that were reported by other authors to determine its efficiency. Comparisons were made using several quality metrics and with statistical analyses. The average improvements in hypervolume and set coverage were between 5.34% and 55.75%, and 53.01% and 100%, respectively. Based on the statistical analyses, the proposed algorithm was found to produce statistically significant improvements compared to other algorithms, thus highlighting the relevance of the proposed approach for protein encoding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioinformatics; Many-objective optimization problem; Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III; Problem-aware mutations; Protein encoding","Encoding (symbols); Genetic algorithms; Signal encoding; Statistical methods; Synthetic biology; Many-objective optimization problem; Many-objective optimizations; Mutation operators; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective approaches; Optimization problems; Problem-aware mutation; Protein encoding; Proteins","","","This study was partially funded by Junta de Extremadura (Spain) and the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund, EU), grant GR18090 provided to the research group TIC015.

It has been proven that these neurodegenerative diseases are mainly caused by the interaction of different SNPs. The complexity of identifying genetic interactions increases exponentially with two factors: (i) the number of SNPs contained in the biological dataset under study and (ii) the number of SNPs involved in the interaction. Therefore, this paper proposes the application of two of the most successful multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to solve this problem: a Reference-point based Many-objective Fast Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) and a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition with Dynamical Resource Allocation (MOEA/D-DRA). These algorithms have been tested with four datasets (including a real dataset about Bipolar Disorder with 425,574 SNPs) and three interaction sizes: 2, 5, and 8 loci. In addition, they have been compared against well-known and relevant approaches published in the literature, in both multiobjective and biological terms. The results clearly show the advantages of the approach based on NSGA-III. Particularly, NSGA-III improves the results obtained by other algorithms in multiobjective terms (by means of Hypervolume and Set Coverage indicators) and in biological terms (by means of Power, Recall, Precision, and F-measure metrics). Moreover, it reveals new 2 and 5 loci interactions over a Bipolar Disorder real dataset. Therefore, NSGA-III represents a relevant approach to detect high-order genetic interactions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High-order genetic interaction; MOEA/D-DRA; NSGA-III; SNP","Bioinformatics; Genetic algorithms; Genetic interaction; High-order; High-order genetic interaction; Higher-order; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with dynamical resource allocation; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; NSGA-III; Resources allocation; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","Funding text 1: This work was partially funded by the MCIU (Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain) , the AEI (State Research Agency, Spain) , and the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund, EU) , under the contract PID2019-107299GB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (Multi-HPC-Bio project).

However, this process may often lead to controversial and economically unfavorable designs. In this regard, developing an optimization model to determine design variables (support system parameters) is necessary. In this study, a stochastic optimization model is developed to determine the support system parameters of a subway station constructed using CAPS. To estimate the risk of uncertainties of the soil properties, the concept of conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used.

Then, the results are applied to prepare multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, which are subsequently used as meta-models and linked to a reference-point-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). It should be noted that the selection of the NSGA-III algorithm was based on comparing its performance with a few other meta-heuristic algorithms such as NSGA-II, MOPSO, and MOMBIII considering metrics such as hypervolume (HV), inverted generational distance (IGD), spread, and pure diversity (PD). Finally, all optimal solutions are ranked using the ELECTRE multi-criteria decision-making method. Various weighting scenarios for the objectives are considered to evaluate the importance of the selected design criteria. The results of the numerical modeling confirm that the proposed algorithm can provide worthwhile information for a logical decision about the support system parameters of a subway station. Thus, the outcome of this study is to achieve an appropriate and economical design by minimizing four following objectives: the risk of instability, risk of the maximum surface settlement, risk of the maximum displacement throughout the station structure, and the concreting volume. The presented algorithm could also alter the prioritization of design goals based on the project's sensitivity and the designer's judgment. On the other hand, by considering the uncertainty in soil parameters, the optimal parameters of the support system are determined more accurately in comparison with an assumption of homogenous soil. Therefore, the main contribution of this article to the design of a subway station constructed by the CAPS method is to increase the accuracy of the design of support system parameters by considering the risk of uncertainties in soil parameters, the importance of the project, and goals of the designer. In this way; the overly conservative designs in practice would be avoided. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial neural network; Conditional Value at Risk; ELECTRE; Finite Element Method; NSGA-III; Subway station design","Arches; Computer software; Design; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Neural networks; Risk perception; Soils; Stochastic models; Subway stations; Uncertainty analysis; Value engineering; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Electre; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Stochastic optimization model; Subway station design; Support systems; Supporting systems; Systems parameters; Uncertainty; Finite element method","","","The authors are grateful for developing the PlatEMO tool by Dr. Ye Tian and his colleagues. https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO.","Abualigah, Laith Mohammad Qasim, Advances in Sine Cosine Algorithm: A comprehensive survey, Artificial Intelligence Review, 54, 4, pp. 2567-2608, (2021); Abualigah, Laith Mohammad Qasim, The Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 376, (2021); Abualigah, Laith Mohammad Qasim, Aquila Optimizer: A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 157, (2021); Álvarez-Fernández, M.

However, the job processing time usually is uncertain and changeable during manufacturing. This paper presents a multi-objective FJSP with fuzzy processing time (MOFFJSP) for optimizing the makespan and total machine workload as objectives. To solve the MOFFJSP, a MOEA/D based on reinforcement learning named RMOEA/D is proposed. RMOEA/D can be featured as: (i) an initial strategy with three rules is used to get a high-quality initial population; (ii) a parameter adaption strategy based on Q-learning is proposed to guide the population choose the best parameter to increase diversity; (iii) a variable neighborhood search based on reinforcement learning is designed to lead the solution to choose the right local search method; and (iv) an elite archive is used to improve the usage rate of the abandoned historical solution. RMOEA/D is compared with five well-known realted methods, i.e., MOEA/D, NSGA-II, MOEA/D-M2M, NSGA-III and IAIS on three benchmark suites.

A recent study has shown that a chronological sequence of nondominated solutions obtained along the successive generations of an optimizer possesses salient patterns that can be learnt using a Machine Learning (ML) model, and can help the offspring solutions progress in useful directions. This article enhances each constitutive module of the above approach, including novel interventions on management of the convergence-diversity tradeoff while mapping the solutions from the previous and current generation; use of a computationally more efficient ML method, namely, Random Forest (RF); and changing the manner and extent to which the learnt ML model is utilized toward advancement of the offspring. The proposed modules constitute what is called the enhanced innovized progress (IP2) operator. To investigate the search efficacy provided by the IP2 operator, it is integrated with multi-and many-objective optimization algorithms, such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MaOEA-IGD, and tested on a range of two- to ten-objective test problems, and five real-world problems. Since the IP2 operator utilizes the history of gradual and progressive improvements in solutions over generations, without requiring any additional solution evaluations, it opens up a new direction for ML-assisted evolutionary optimization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Innovization; Innovized Progress (IP); learning-assisted optimization; machine learning (ML); multiobjective optimization; online Innovization","Decision trees; Internet protocols; Learning systems; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Innovization; Innovized progress; IP-network; Learning-assisted optimization; Machine-learning; Multi-objectives optimization; Online innovization.; Optimisations; Radiofrequencies; Search problem; Pareto principle","","","","Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2002); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Jain, Himanshu, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point based nondominated sorting approach, Part II: Handling constraints and extending to an adaptive approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 602-622, (2014); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Du, Yu, A hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm for distributed flexible job shop scheduling with crane transportations, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 62, (2021); Scoczynski Ribeiro Martins, Marcella Scoczynski Ribeiro, Analysis of Bayesian Network Learning Techniques for a Hybrid Multi-objective Bayesian Estimation of Distribution Algorithm: a case study on MNK Landscape, Journal of Heuristics, 27, 4, pp. 549-573, (2021); Mittal, Sukrit, A Learning-based Innovized Progress Operator for Faster Convergence in Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization, 2, 1, (2021); Gaur, Abhinav, Effect of size and order of variables in rules for multi-objective repair-based innovization procedure, pp. 2177-2184, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120543150"

In the Monte-Carlo (MC) method, many transistor-level simulations should be performed to obtain the desired result. Therefore, some methods are needed to be combined with MC simulations to reach high yield with high speed at the same time. In this paper, a four-stage yield optimisation approach is presented, which employs computational intelligence to accelerate yield estimation without losing accuracy. Firstly, the designs that met the desired characteristics are provided using critical analysis (CA). The aim of utilising CA is to avoid unnecessary MC simulations repeating for non-critical solutions. Then in the second and third stages, the shuffled frog-leaping algorithm and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III are proposed to improve the performance. Finally, MC simulations are performed to present the final result. The yield value obtained from the simulation results for two-stage class-AB Operational Transconductance Amplifer (OTA) in 180 nm Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology is 99.85%. The proposed method has less computational effort and high accuracy than the MC-based approaches. Another advantage of using CA is that the initial population of multi-objective optimisation algorithms will no longer be random. Simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed technique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","critical analysis; evolutionary algorithm; Monte Carlo simulations; speed up yield; yield optimisation","Analog integrated circuits; Budget control; CMOS integrated circuits; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Metals; MOS devices; Multiobjective optimization; Operational amplifiers; Oxide semiconductors; Timing circuits; Critical analysis; Higher yield; Monte Carlo's simulation; MonteCarlo methods; Optimal computing budget allocation; Optimization techniques; Speed up; Speed up yield; Yield estimation; Yield optimization; Monte Carlo methods","","","This work was supported by the Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University.","Șandru, Elena Diana, Modeling the Dependency of Analog Circuit Performance Parameters on Manufacturing Process Variations with Applications in Sensitivity Analysis and Yield Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 41, 1, pp. 129-142, (2022); Milor, Linda, A survey of yield modeling and yield enhancement methods, IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 26, 2, pp. 196-213, (2013); Kondamadugula, Sita, Parameter-importance based monte-carlo technique for variation-aware analog yield optimization, Proceedings of the ACM Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI, GLSVLSI, 18-20-May-2016, pp. 51-56, (2016); Fakhfakh, Mourad, Computational intelligence in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) and radio-frequency (RF) circuit design, pp. 1-491, (2015); Fredenburg, Jeffrey A., Statistical analysis of ENOB and yield in binary weighted ADCs and DACS with random element mismatch, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, 59, 7, pp. 1396-1408, (2012); Liu, Xuexin, Performance bound and yield analysis for analog circuits under process variations, Proceedings of the Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, ASP-DAC, pp. 761-766, (2013); Tian, Wei, Novel methods for circuit worst-case tolerance analysis, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications, 43, 4, pp. 272-278, (1996); Microelectronic Manufacturing Yield Reliability and Failure Analysis II, (1996); Sengupta, Manidip, Application-specific worst case corners using response surfaces and statistical models, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 24, 9, pp. 1372-1380, (2005); Park, Henry A., An INL yield model of the digital-to-analog converter, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, 60, 3, pp. 582-592, (2013)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","1751861X; 17518601","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139446839"

An aeroengine-lubricating oil tank with three mounting pedestals is simplified as a three-support dynamic system, and its dynamics model is established. Several structural parameters of mounting pedestals are taken as the design variables, and the system vibration response and the reaction force of the front and rear mounting pedestals are considered as the objective functions. The first-order results and total sensitivity index of different design parameters for each objective function are obtained via SSAM, and the five most sensitive parameters are selected. Based on the above five design parameters, multi-objective optimization designing for vibration reduction in a simplified lubricating oil tank system is conducted based on NSGA-Ⅲ, and the results of the above triple-objective optimization are obtained as a Pareto-front surface with an obvious frontier. It can be observed from the simulation results that the oil tank vibration of the optimized system is effectively suppressed under the unbalanced excitation of two typical engine speeds. The established method and the main results can provide guidance for designers of aeroengine external structural systems, which can help to achieve superior system dynamic performances in engineering applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","multi-objective optimization; multi-support rigid body system; NSGA-Ⅲ; sensitivity analysis; Sobol’s method; structural optimization","Genetic algorithms; Lubricating oils; Lubrication; Mountings; Multiobjective optimization; Rigid structures; Sensitivity analysis; Shape optimization; Vibration analysis; Aero-engine; Multi support; Multi-objectives optimization; Multi-support rigid body system; NSGA-ⅲ; Parameter sensitivity analysis; Rigid body systems; S-method; Sobol’s method; Structural optimisations; Structural optimization","","","This research was funded by [National Natural Science Foundation of China] grant number [No.1207020431].","Kaul, Sudhir, Engine mount optimisation for vibration isolation in motorcycles, Vehicle System Dynamics, 47, 4, pp. 419-436, (2009); Bronowicki, Allen J., Vibration isolator for large space telescopes, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 43, 1, pp. 45-53, (2006); Chu, Xuyang, Multi-objective topology optimization for industrial robot, pp. 1919-1923, (2017); París, José, Topology optimization of aeronautical structures with stress constraints: General methodology and applications, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 226, 5, pp. 589-600, (2012); Yang, Meng, The structure optimization for nonlinear vibration reduction system of the tracked ambulance, Journal of Vibroengineering, 19, 1, pp. 577-591, (2017); Caresta, Mauro, Reduction of hull-radiated noise using vibroacoustic optimization of the propulsion system, Journal of Ship Research, 55, 3, pp. 149-162, (2011); Deaton, Joshua D., A survey of structural and multidisciplinary continuum topology optimization: Post 2000, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 49, 1, pp. 1-38, (2014); Min, Seungjae, Unified topology design of static and vibrating structures using multiobjective optimization, Computers and Structures, 75, 1, pp. 93-116, (2000); Tan, Luyang, Multi-objective topology optimization to reduce vibration of micro-satellite primary supporting structure, Journal of Vibroengineering, 19, 2, pp. 831-843, (2017); Kapania, Rakesh K., Optimal design of unitized panels with curvilinear stiffeners, 3, pp. 1708-1737, (2005)","","MDPI","","","","","","14248220","","","36146416","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138413108"

In the case of producing concentrates of the same quality, compared with using only high-grade raw ore, ore blending is a way to slow down the decline of ore geological grade by combining high- and low-grade raw ore. There are many ore blending models considering cost minimization or profit maximization as the target value, ignoring the fact that ore blending is intended to obtain a homogenized product. Moreover, the ore blending model cannot be solved by traditional operational research methods when blended grade stability of multiple elements is considered in the ore blending program. In this paper, a multi-objective ore blending optimization model is constructed for the comprehensive utilization of associated resources in ores. It minimizes the deviation of the grade of each metallic element in the blended associated ore from the beneficiation grade and the percentage of different types of rocks at the unloading point. To solve this multi-objective optimization model, an intelligent optimization method is proposed that is an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III). The case study shows that the proposed model and algorithm can effectively solve the mixing problem of polymetallic ores and obtain a satisfactory ore blending solution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CM-NSGA-III; evolutionary algorithm; mining sustainability; multi-objective optimization; ore blending problem","algorithm; mining industry; multiobjective programming; numerical model; optimization; sustainable development; unloading","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 52074205; National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 51774228; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, grant number 2019M662505.","Nwaila, Glen T., Geometallurgical Approach for Implications of Ore Blending on Cyanide Leaching and Adsorption Behavior of Witwatersrand Gold Ores, South Africa, Natural Resources Research, 29, 2, pp. 1007-1030, (2020); Sotoudeh, Farzad, Production scheduling optimisation for sublevel stoping mines using mathematical programming: A review of literature and future directions, Resources Policy, 68, (2020); Yu, Shiwei, A hybrid intelligent optimization method for multiple metal grades optimization, Neural Computing and Applications, 21, 6, pp. 1391-1402, (2012); Githiria, Joseph Muchiri, A stochastic cut-off grade optimization model to incorporate uncertainty for improved project value, Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 119, 3, pp. 217-228, (2019); Khan, Asif, An optimal cut-off grade policy under diverse stockpile handling strategies in open-pit mining operations, International Journal of Mining, Reclamation and Environment, pp. 1-11, (2020); Chanda, Emmanuel Knox C., Optimal blending of mine production using goal programming and interactive graphics systems, International Journal of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Environment, 9, 4, pp. 203-208, (1995); Procedia Earth and Planetary Science, (2013); Danish, Abid Ali Khan, A simulated annealing based approach for open pit mine production scheduling with stockpiling option, Resources Policy, 71, (2021); Armstrong, Margaret, Adaptive open-pit mining planning under geological uncertainty, Resources Policy, 72, (2021); van Tonder, E., The effect of ore blends on the mineral processing of platinum ores, Minerals Engineering, 23, 8, pp. 621-626, (2010)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137876302"

In these processes, route planning is an important guarantee for reducing navigation distance and saving total turning angle. However, minimizing the cost of the entire navigation process on the premise of completing agricultural work is difficult. Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithm is used to solve the route planning problem of agricultural mobile robots under the premise of minimizing navigation cost. By scanning the radar map of the greenhouse, the path between all target points is calculated by using the probabilistic roadmap (PRM), and the route planning of the agricultural robot is carried out according to the sum of the path length and the path angle. To determine the best route for agricultural mobile robots, four algorithms are compared: Hypervolume Estimation Algorithm (HypE), Grid-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (GrEA), Knee Point-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm (KnEA), and Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). The quality of the solutions was compared using C-Metric, and it could verify that HypE offers the best performance among four algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural mobile robot; Greenhouse; Many-objective optimization; Route planning","Agriculture; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouses; Navigation; Robot programming; Agricultural mobile robot; Agricultural robot; Estimation algorithm; Hypervolume; Many-objective optimizations; Process route; Robot route planning; Robot technology; Route planning; Turning angles; Mobile robots; genetic algorithm; greenhouse effect; navigation; optimization","","","This research was financially supported by 2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University, Overseas High-level Youth Talents Program (China Agricultural University, China, Grant No. 62339001).

In effect, it brings the problem closer to real-world applications. Five objectives have been defined: cost, duration, average cash flow, average usage of resources and skill overuse. To summarize MS-RCPSP usage, the paper presents a short survey (years 2015–2021) of multi- and many-objective MS–RCPSP solving methods. Moreover, results of investigation of many-objective MS–RCPSP for classic (greedy algorithm, Unified Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (U-NSGA-III)), single objective (decomposition-based) Differential Evolution And Greedy (DEGR) and state-of-the-art Non-dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm (NTGA2) have been presented. Additionally, results are analysed using multi-objective quality measures (such as Pareto Front Size (PFS), Purity or Inverted Generational Distance (IGD)) to verify the efficiency of the used methods. The paper answers 4 research questions that investigate 5-objective MS-RCPSP domains, approximations of Pareto Fronts, relations between objectives and efficiency of NTGA2 compared to other methods.

This paper studies the problem of locating MECs and slices in a 5G infrastructure protected by a 1: N: K protection scheme. The aim is to support high reliability and low latency requirements at a minimum cost. A bi-objective non-linear formulation is proposed, and a solution is derived by employing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II.

At present, the springback mechanism still remains unclear due to the complex plastic deformation characteristics of metal materials. It is difficult to obtain the accurate axial springback information before bending forming, not to mention formulating a reasonable processing plan to compensate springback. To alleviate this difficulty, a novel optimization framework is constructed which takes the radius changes series (RCS) as the new axial accuracy evaluation index for the first time. The optimization framework contains a GRU-based deep learning network as the prediction module to predict the springback more reliably. Subsequently, NSGA-III has been improved by the proposed guiding factor (GF) and dynamic reference points (DRF) algorithm, i.e, priority-based NSGA-III (Pb-NSGA-III), which can more efficiently deal with the objectives with different priorities when generating the processing plan. With the help of the finite element (FE) and bending experiment, the springback dataset construction and the accuracy verification can be achieved.

At present, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been used for microservice provision to achieve faster response speed and less network pressure. Based on container technology, microservices can be easily deployed in the MEC environment, while multiple microservice instances in multiple locations need to be selected to provide services for a large number of users geographically distributed. How to fully consider the service response time, scheduling the startup and running strategies of microservice instances with the least resource cost for multiple mobile edge servers is the core problem of microservice composition. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary approach (MSCMOE) based on improved NSGA-III to minimize the service access delay and network resource consumption in the process of microservice composition. In order to maintain the diversity of the population, we use the improved reference point strategy to enhance the computational efficiency of seeking elite solutions in the non-dominated layer. Experimental results based on a real data set of Shanghai Telecom demonstrate that MSCMOE can effectively reduce network resource consumption while reducing service request time. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Microservices; Mobile edge computing; Multi-objective optimization; QoS; Service composition","Application programs; Computational efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Internet of things; Mobile edge computing; Multiobjective optimization; Fast response; Joint optimization; Less networks; Microservice; Multi-objectives optimization; Network resource; Resources consumption; Response speed; Services composition; Software technology; Quality of service","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant no. 61976061 and 61602169, and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province under grant no. 2021JJ30278, as well as the Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department under grant no. 20C0809 and 18A186.","Abbas, Nasir, Mobile Edge Computing: A Survey, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 1, pp. 450-465, (2018); Bhamare, Deval, Multi-objective scheduling of micro-services for optimal service function chains, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, (2017); Chemodanov, Dmitrii, A Near Optimal Reliable Composition Approach for Geo-Distributed Latency-Sensitive Service Chains, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2019-April, pp. 1792-1800, (2019); Cherradi, Ghyzlane, Real-Time HazMat Environmental Information System: A micro-service based architecture, Procedia Computer Science, 109, pp. 982-987, (2017); Chi, Kaikai, Coding Schemes to Minimize Energy Consumption of Communication Links in Wireless Nanosensor Networks, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 3, 4, pp. 480-493, (2016); Deng, Shuiguang, Cost performance driven service mashup: A developer perspective, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 27, 8, pp. 2234-2247, (2016); Gao, Honghao, A Dynamic Planning Framework for QoS-Based Mobile Service Composition Under Cloud-Edge Hybrid Environments, Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST, 292, pp. 58-70, (2019); Gouareb, Racha, Virtual Network Functions Routing and Placement for Edge Cloud Latency Minimization, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 36, 10, pp. 2346-2357, (2018); 23rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Icdcs 2003 19 22 May 2003 Providence Ri Usa P 194 IEEE Computer Society, (2003); Gu, Lin, Cost efficient resource management in fog computing supported medical cyber-physical system, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 5, 1, pp. 108-119, (2017)","","Springer","","","","","","1386145X; 15731413","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124872625"

In most current researches, only single objective function is used in the path planning for the UAVs, and some other objectives are seldom considered together, like: the number of UAVs, the required inspection time and so on. Therefore, in order to overcome the defect of using single objective function to plan the path of UAVs, a many-objective optimization based multiple UAVs path planning method is studied in this paper. Firstly, four objective functions are chosen which include the flight distance, the flight stability, the number of UAVs and the time offset of reaching the task point; considering the arrival time of UAVs at each task point is an interval value in the practical application, the time offset of reaching the task point is set as an interval objective function, which is handled by the matter-element extension method in this paper. Then, an improved NSGA-III algorithm is proposed to solve the established many-objective optimization problem, which uses fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) to replace the genetic algorithm (GA) in the NSGA-III algorithm. Finally, several evaluation indictors (Spread, generational distance (GD), inverse generational distance (IGD), and running time) are used to choose the optimal flight paths of multiple UAVs. Through simulation comparisons with other algorithms, it is concluded that the improved NSGA-III algorithm is more effective in the path planning of UAVs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fruit fly optimization algorithm; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III algorithm; Oilfield inspection; Path planning","Antennas; Fruits; Genetic algorithms; Inverse problems; Motion planning; Oil fields; Aerial vehicle; Fly optimization algorithms; Fruit fly optimization algorithm; Fruitflies; Many-objective optimizations; NSGA-III algorithm; Objective functions; Oilfield inspection; Single objective; Time offsets; Inspection","","","","Shukla, Amit, Autonomous tracking of oil and gas pipelines by an unmanned aerial vehicle, Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 0, (2016); Cho, Jaeyoung, Safety and Security Management with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in Oil and Gas Industry, Procedia Manufacturing, 3, pp. 1343-1349, (2015); Gómez, Cristina, Small unmanned airborne systems to support oil and gas pipeline monitoring and mapping, Arabian Journal of Geosciences, 10, 9, (2017); Yan, Yamin, A two-stage optimization method for unmanned aerial vehicle inspection of an oil and gas pipeline network, Petroleum Science, 16, 2, pp. 458-468, (2019); Chen, Yongbo, UAV path planning using artificial potential field method updated by optimal control theory, International Journal of Systems Science, 47, 6, pp. 1407-1420, (2016); Wang, Honglun, Three-dimensional path planning for unmanned aerial vehicle based on interfered fluid dynamical system, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 28, 1, pp. 229-239, (2015); Ammar, Adel H., Relaxed Dijkstra and A* with linear complexity for robot path planning problems in large-scale grid environments, Soft Computing, 20, 10, pp. 4149-4171, (2016); Zuo, Lei, A hierarchical path planning approach based on A* and least-squares policy iteration for mobile robots, Neurocomputing, 170, pp. 257-266, (2015); da Silva Arantes, Jesimar, Heuristic and Genetic Algorithm Approaches for UAV Path Planning under Critical Situation, International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 26, 1, (2017); Ma, Yong, Path planning for mobile objects in four-dimension based on particle swarm optimization method with penalty function, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2013, (2013)","","Springer","","","","","","15737497; 0924669X","9780511611445; 9780521884280","APITE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124508281"

However, with the increased number of decision variables in EMOPs, the prediction accuracy of surrogate models will deteriorate, which inevitably worsens the performance of SAEAs. To deal with this issue, this article suggests an ensemble surrogate-based framework for tackling EMOPs. In this framework, a global surrogate model is trained under the entire search space to explore the global area, while a number of surrogate submodels are trained under different search subspaces to exploit the subarea, so as to enhance the prediction accuracy and reliability. Moreover, a new infill sampling criterion is designed based on a set of reference vectors to select promising samples for training the models. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, three state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms [nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with differential evolution (MOEA/D-DE) and reference vector-guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA)] are embedded, which significantly improve their performance for solving most of the test EMOPs adopted in this article. When compared to some competitive SAEAs for solving EMOPs with up to 30 decision variables, the experimental results also validate the advantages of our approach in most cases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ensemble surrogate; evolutionary algorithms; model management; multiobjective optimization","Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Decision variables; Differential Evolution; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective evolutionary optimizations; Multi-objective optimization problem; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Sampling criterions; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Maier, Holger R., Introductory overview: Optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other metaheuristics, Environmental Modelling and Software, 114, pp. 195-213, (2019); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, (2001); Li, Hui, Multiobjective optimization problems with complicated pareto sets, MOEA/ D and NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 13, 2, pp. 284-302, (2009); Liu, Hailin, Decomposition of a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of simple multiobjective subproblems, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 3, pp. 450-455, (2014); Zitzler, Eckart, Indicator-based selection in multiobjective search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3242, pp. 832-842, (2004); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Kozieł, Sławomir Marcin, Rapid Simulation-Driven Multiobjective Design Optimization of Decomposable Compact Microwave Passives, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 64, 8, pp. 2454-2461, (2016); Guo, Dan, Small data driven evolutionary multi-objective optimization of fused magnesium furnaces, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112565354"

However, these studies are still rare in certain software engineering fields. In this paper, we replicate and extend a previous study, which denotes the current state-of-the-art for multi-objective software effort estimation, namely CoGEE. We investigate the original research questions with an independent implementation and the inclusion of a more robust baseline (LP4EE), carried out by the first author, who was not involved in the original study. Through this replication, we strengthen both the internal and external validity of the original study. We also answer two new research questions investigating the effectiveness of CoGEE by using four additional evolutionary algorithms (i.e., IBEA, MOCell, NSGA-III, SPEA2) and a well-known Java framework for evolutionary computation, namely JMetal (rather than the previously used R software), which allows us to strengthen the external validity of the original study. The results of our replication confirm that: (1) CoGEE outperforms both baseline and state-of-the-art benchmarks statistically significantly ($p <0.001$p<0.001); (2) CoGEE's multi-objective nature makes it able to reach such a good performance; (3) CoGEE's estimation errors lie within claimed industrial human-expert-based thresholds. Moreover, our new results show that the effectiveness of CoGEE is generally not limited to nor dependent on the choice of the multi-objective algorithm. Using CoGEE with either NSGA-II, NSGA-III, or MOCell produces human competitive results in less than a minute. The Java version of CoGEE has decreased the running time by over 99.8 percent with respect to its R counterpart. We have made publicly available the Java code of CoGEE to ease its adoption, as well as, the data used in this study in order to allow for future replication and extension of our work. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","confidence interval; estimates uncertainty; multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; Software effort estimation","Benchmarking; Computer software; Java programming language; Estimation errors; External validities; Multi objective; Multi objective algorithm; Replication study; Research questions; Software effort estimation; State of the art; Evolutionary algorithms","","","The work of Vali Tawosi, Federica Sarro, Alessio Petrozziello and Mark Harman at UCL was supported by the ERC Advanced fellowship grant no. 741278 (EPIC)","Cran Package Nsga2r, (2013); International Function Point Users Group, (2020); Lp4ee Linear Programming for Effort Estimation, (2020); R Project for Statistical Computing, (2020); Angelis, Lefteris, A simulation tool for efficient analogy based cost estimation, Empirical Software Engineering, 5, 1, pp. 35-68, (2000); Arcuri, Andrea, A Hitchhiker's guide to statistical tests for assessing randomized algorithms in software engineering, Software Testing Verification and Reliability, 24, 3, pp. 219-250, (2014); Bakır, Ayşe, A comparative study for estimating software development effort intervals, Software Quality Journal, 19, 3, pp. 537-552, (2011); Barros, Márcio O., An analysis of the effects of composite objectives in multiobjective software module clustering, pp. 1205-1212, (2012); Boehm, Barry W., Software Engineering Economics, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, SE-10, 1, pp. 4-21, (1984); Bosu, Michael Franklin, Experience: Quality benchmarking of datasets used in software effort estimation, Journal of Data and Information Quality, 11, 4, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","00985589","","IESED","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107206478"

Our proposed method combines the means for population partitioning, monitoring, and adaptive normalization, within the framework of the NSGA-III algorithm, which takes the hyperplane deployment scheme into account in its entirety. Compared to the traditional genetic algorithm toolbox of the joint COMSOL optimization scheme, it is shown that the joint parallel simulation optimization method that is constructed in this paper achieves a higher optimization efficiency and a better experimental performance, thereby aiding in the identification of the optimal solution to multiple objectives. The optimization efficiency can increase linearly as the number of available cores on the computer increases. This method is then used to construct a parallel, low-frequency, broadband, highly-sound-absorbing structure.

It combined the modern design of experiments (DOE) method known as Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), Kriging surrogate model training, and the multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-III into the optimization of a triplet optical system. Compared with the methods that rely mainly on optical system simulation, this surrogate model-based multi-objective optimization method can achieve a high-accuracy result with significantly improved optimization efficiency. Using this model, case studies were carried out for two-objective optimizations of a Cooke triplet optical system. The results showed that the weighted geometric spot diagram and the maximum field curvature were reduced 5.32% and 11.59%, respectively, in the first case. In the second case, where the initial parameters were already optimized by Code-V, this model further reduced the weighted geometric spot diagram and the maximum field curvature by another 3.53% and 4.33%, respectively. The imaging quality in both cases was considerably improved compared with the initial design, indicating that the model is suitable for the optimal design of an optical system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","experimental design; Kriging; multi-objective optimization; ray tracing; surrogate model","","","","","Optimization Techniques in Lens Design, (1971); Dilworth, Donald C., Automatic lens optimization: Recent improvements, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 554, pp. 191-196, (1986); Dynamic Programming, (2003); Hegde, Ravi Sadananda, Accelerating optics design optimizations with deep learning, Optical Engineering, 58, 6, (2019); Queipo, Néstor V., Surrogate-based analysis and optimization, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 41, 1, pp. 1-28, (2005); Forrester, Alexander I.J., Recent advances in surrogate-based optimization, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, 45, 1-3, pp. 50-79, (2009); Liu, Dianjing, Training Deep Neural Networks for the Inverse Design of Nanophotonic Structures, ACS Photonics, 5, 4, pp. 1365-1369, (2018); Liu, Zhaocheng, Generative Model for the Inverse Design of Metasurfaces, Nano Letters, 18, 10, pp. 6570-6576, (2018); Zhang, Tian, Efficient spectrum prediction and inverse design for plasmonic waveguide systems based on artificial neural networks, Photonics Research, 7, 3, pp. 368-380, (2019); Malkiel, Itzik, Plasmonic nanostructure design and characterization via Deep Learning, Light: Science and Applications, 7, 1, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133856131"

Five machine learning models are adopted as base learners, including autoregressive moving average, multi-layer perceptron, Elman neural network, deep echo state network, and long short-term memory. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III is applied to automatically combine these base learners, generating an accurate and robust ensemble model. The proposed model is tested on several actual robot trajectory datasets and evaluated by several metrics.

However, the available caregivers are insufficient to serve all the customers who make an appointment in advance. Besides, there are actually some uncertain parameters such as travel and service times when implementing the given schedule. Hence, this paper presents a home health care routing and scheduling problem (HHCRSP) by considering customers’ priorities and times uncertainty. A fuzzy multi-objective optimization model is established to maximize the total priority of all visited customers and minimize the total service cost. Jimenez's method is utilized to transform the fuzzy parameters in the model. A discrete multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (DMOGWO) is proposed to solve the model. In the DMOGWO, the heuristic rule of priority maximum-earliest service is designed to generate the initial solution. An individual position updating mechanism is developed to make the algorithm suitable for discrete search space. Subsequently, three neighborhood structures are designed to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. Finally, the DMOGWO is compared with CPLEX, MOGWO, MOPSO, NSGA-II and NSGA-III. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DMOGWO is competitive in convergence, diversity and distribution of the solutions on many instances. This shows that the proposed DMOGWO can effectively solve the home care routing and scheduling problem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customers’ priorities; Fuzzy service time and travel time; Home health care optimization; Multi-objective grey wolf optimizer","Home health care; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling; Travel time; Uncertainty analysis; Care optimization; Customer’ priority; Fuzzy service time and travel time; Gray wolves; Home health care optimization; Multi objective; Multi-objective gray wolf optimizer; Optimizers; Service time; Travel-time; Sales","","","This study is supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (Grant No. 19YJCZH091) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71872002).","Braekers, Kris, A bi-objective home care scheduling problem: Analyzing the trade-off between costs and client inconvenience, European Journal of Operational Research, 248, 2, pp. 428-443, (2016); Cissé, Mohamed E., OR problems related to Home Health Care: A review of relevant routing and scheduling problems, Operations Research for Health Care, 13-14, pp. 1-22, (2017); Coello, Carlos A., Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 8, 3, pp. 256-279, (2004); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Decerle, Jérémy, A general model for the home health care routing and scheduling problem with route balancing, 50, 1, pp. 14662-14667, (2017); Decerle, Jérémy, A memetic algorithm for a home health care routing and scheduling problem, Operations Research for Health Care, 16, pp. 59-71, (2018); Decerle, Jérémy, A hybrid memetic-ant colony optimization algorithm for the home health care problem with time window, synchronization and working time balancing, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 46, pp. 171-183, (2019); Dong, Jun, Research on collaborative optimization of green manufacturing in semiconductor wafer distributed heterogeneous factory, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 9, 14, (2019); Du, Gang, Real-time scheduling optimization considering the unexpected events in home health care, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 37, 1, pp. 196-220, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131442474"

The upper model determines the optimal scheduling scheme of jobs to minimize makespan. On this basis, the lower model obtains the power supply allocation scheme of distributed energy resources (DERs), energy storage system (ESS) and main grid to minimize total carbon emissions and total energy consumption costs.

Although most of these tools have been successful for one or two objective designs, they tend to become ineffective to fulfill the requirements of the desired Pareto-Optimal Front (POF) for many and multi-objective (MO) problems. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-objective analog circuit optimization tool that employs a hybrid guided random search technique. We adapted the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 3 (NSGA-III) to the analog circuit sizing problem and combined it with simulated annealing (SA) based single-objective (SO) genetic algorithm (GA). This implementation enables the construction of homogeneous POFs in many-dimensional objective spaces. To our best knowledge, this is the first implementation of the NSGA-III in analog electronic design automation (EDA). For demonstration purposes, we optimized two OTA circuits by using the proposed tool, the standard NSGA-III and SPEA-2 based analog circuit optimizers. According to the synthesis results, the proposed tool and 2-objective NSGA-III outperform 2-objective SPEA-2 in terms of POF quality. Specifically, our proposed tool achieved the best results in the maximum spread metrics, outperforming both 2-objective NSGA-III and SPEA2 in all case studies.

Five objectives related to the system as a whole and another three interacting entities are optimised simultaneously. A mathematical model is formulated for the first time for this type of layout.

The performances of NSTLBO III are benchmarked in the sense of Pareto efficiency with two well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, i.e. non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA III) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D).

This article presents an innovative method using an improved multiobjective algorithm to solve the path optimization problem for autonomous land levelling operations. First, an environment model was built based on collected field data, and a model decomposition method was proposed to decompose the field terrain model and realize complete land levelling. Then, a three-objective problem model (consisting of the travelling distance, steering angle and earthwork) was developed, and the Pareto set of the travel sequence was obtained using a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Using Decomposition and Further Mutation Ant Colony (MOEA/D-FMACO). Finally, the path optimization of five field cases based on three algorithms, the MOEA/D-FMACO, MOEA/D-ACO and NSGA-III, was simulated in MATLAB. The simulation results show that the MOEA/D-FMACO has better solution performance quality compared with the other two algorithms and shortens the execution time. In field experiments, a GNSS-based land leveller controlled by automatic steering and levelling systems tracked the planned paths based on the MOEA/D-FMACO and a previous method for a field in two periods. The field results verified that the land levelling effect based on the optimization paths of the MOEA/D-FMACO had a significant improvement over the previous method. The proposed method decreased the maximum elevation difference (ΔZ) by 10.5 cm and the flatness of the field (S<inf>d</inf>) by 4.3 cm and increased the elevation distribution around the target elevation (η) by 11.15% compared to the previous method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ant colony (ACO); Autonomous land levelling; Decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms (MOEA/D); Multipath optimization","Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Excavation; Foundations; MATLAB; Multiobjective optimization; Ant colonies; Ant colony; Autonomous land leveling; Decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D); Land leveling; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; Multipath; Multipath optimization; Optimisations; Ant colony optimization; algorithm; elevation; optimization; simulation","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2017YFD0701100-2017YFD0701105).; Funding text 2: We acknowledge the Shangzhuang experimental station of the China Agricultural University in Haidian District for using their fields and facilities as well as all the farmers involved in the experimental data collection.

The DoM indicator can differentiate the sets for certain important features, such as convergence, spread, uniformity, and cardinality. DoM does not require any reference point or any representative Pareto solution set, and it has an intuitive and physical meaning, similar to the epsilon; -indicator. It calculates the minimum total move of members of one set so that all elements in another set are to be dominated or identical to at least one member of the first set. Despite the aforementioned desired properties, DoM is hard to calculate, particularly for higher dimensions. There is an efficient and exact method to calculate it in biobjective problems. This work proposes a novel approach to calculate DoM using a mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach, which can handle two sets with two or more objectives and is shown to overcome the issue of information loss associated with the epsilon; -indicator. Experiments in the biobjective space are done to verify the model's correctness. Furthermore, other experiments, using 3-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-objective problems, are performed to show how the model behaves in higher dimensional cases. Algorithms, such as IBEA, MOEA/D, NSGA-III, NSGA-II, and SPEA2, are used to generate the solution sets; however, any other algorithm can also be used with the proposed MIP-DoM indicator. Further extensions are discussed to handle certain idiosyncrasies with some solution sets and improve the quality indicator and its use for other scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithms; mixed-integer programming (MIP); multicriteria optimization; multiobjective optimization; performance assessment; quality indicators","Calculations; Software engineering; Higher dimensions; Higher-dimensional; Important features; Many-objective optimizations; Mixed integer programming (MIP); Physical meanings; Quality indicators; Reference points; Integer programming","","","","Chugh, Tinkle, A survey on handling computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems with evolutionary algorithms, Soft Computing, 23, 9, pp. 3137-3166, (2019); González-Álvarez, David L., Analysing the scalability of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms when solving the motif discovery problem, Journal of Global Optimization, 57, 2, pp. 467-497, (2013); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Scope of stationary multi-objective evolutionary optimization: A case study on a hydro-thermal power dispatch problem, Journal of Global Optimization, 41, 4, pp. 479-515, (2008); Li, Bingdong, Many-objective evolutionary algorithms: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 48, 1, (2015); Ibrahim, Amin, 3D-RadVis Antenna: Visualization and performance measure for many-objective optimization, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 39, pp. 157-176, (2018); Bhattacharjee, Kalyan Shankar, Many-objective optimization with limited computing budget, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 833, pp. 17-46, (2020); Talukder, A.

To overcome these issues and achieve parameter optimization of FL on non-Independent Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, a multi-objective FL parameter optimization method based on hierarchical clustering and the third-generation non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) algorithm is proposed, which aims to si-multaneously minimize the global model error rate, global model accuracy distribution variance and communication cost. The introduction of a hierarchical clustering algorithm on non-IID data can accelerate convergence so that FL can employ an evolutionary algorithm with a low FL client participation ratio, reducing the overall communication cost of the NSGA-III algorithm. Meanwhile, the NSGA-III algorithm, with fast greedy initialization and a strategy of discarding low-quality individuals (named NSGA-III-FD), is proposed to improve the convergence efficiency and the quality of Pareto-optimal solutions. Under two non-IID data settings, the CNN experiments on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our approach can obtain better Pareto-optimal solutions than classical evolutionary algorithms, and the selected solutions with an optimized model can achieve better multi-objective equilibrium than the standard federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm and the Clustering-based FedAvg algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","federated learning; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; parameter optimization","","","","Funding: This research was funded by the General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 61871388.","Ribeiro, Mauro, MLaaS: Machine learning as a service, pp. 896-902, (2016); Waring, Jonathan, Automated machine learning: Review of the state-of-the-art and opportunities for healthcare, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 104, (2020); López, Karol Lina, Demand-side management using deep learning for smart charging of electric vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 10, 3, pp. 2683-2691, (2019); Towards the Science of Security and Privacy in Machine Learning, (2016); Mehmood, Abid, Protection of big data privacy, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 1821-1834, (2016); Wachter, Sandra, Why a right to explanation of automated decision-making does not exist in the general data protection regulation, International Data Privacy Law, 7, 2, pp. 76-99, (2017); Chik, Warren B., The Singapore personal data protection act and an assessment of future trends in data privacy reform, Computer Law and Security Review, 29, 5, pp. 554-575, (2013); McMahan, H.

This paper presents a new D-PMU optimal placement method that can be used to reconcile investments with the reliability of high-precision observation systems. The multi-objective optimization model primarily considers the influence of topology changes and N-1 contingencies on observation reliability. Its objectives include minimizing the number of D-PMUs, maximizing network measurement redundancy (NMR) and the average number of observable buses under N-1 contingencies (ANOBC). The model is extended to a form of multi-topology weighting and is combined with zero-injection buses and other measurements. We take the observability of high-weight topology set as the constraint. The model can be solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III), which gives the set of Pareto optimal solutions. Then, the D-PMU placement order determination method based on the spatial electrical distance is proposed to improve the effect of state estimation faster. IEEE standard systems are taken to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the same number of D-PMUs, this method derives more ANOBC and NMR than other methods. When considering topology changes, the proposed method can use fewer additional D-PMUs to substantially increase the ANOBC and NMR. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","active distribution network; D-PMU; N-1 contingencies; non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; observability; topology change","","","","Funding:This research was funded bythe Scienceand Technology Project of the State Grid Corporation of China.

Researchers have divided the constraints of this problem into hard (i.e., feasible solution) and soft constraints (i.e., quality solution). The majority of research has dealt with PAS using integer linear programming (ILP) and single objective meta-heuristic searching-based approaches. ILP-based approaches carry high computational demand and the risk of non-feasibility for a large dataset. In a single objective optimization, there is a risk of local minima due to the non-convexity of the problem. In this article, we present the first pareto front-based optimization for PAS using set of meta-heuristic approaches. We selected four multi-objective optimization methods. Problem-specific operators were developed for each of them. Next, we compared them with single objective optimization approaches, namely, simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. In addition, this article also deals with the dynamical aspect of this problem by comparing historical window-based decomposition with day decomposition, as has previously been proposed in the literature. An evaluation of the models proposed in the article and comparison with traditional models reveals the superiority of our proposed multi-objective optimization with window incorporation in terms of optimality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dynamic optimization; multi-objective optimization; non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II); NSGA-III; patient admission scheduling (PAS)","","","","","Patrick, Jonathan, Automated pathologist scheduling at the ottawa hospital, INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics, 49, 3, pp. 93-103, (2019); Bastos, Leonardo S.L., A mixed integer programming approach to the patient admission scheduling problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 273, 3, pp. 831-840, (2019); Asaju, Bolaji Laaro, Late acceptance hill climbing algorithm for solving patient admission scheduling problem, Knowledge-Based Systems, 145, pp. 197-206, (2018); Elsisi, Mahmoud, Robust model predictive control paradigm for automatic voltage regulators against uncertainty based on optimization algorithms, Mathematics, 9, 22, (2021); Tran, Minh Quang, Effective multi-sensor data fusion for chatter detection in milling process, ISA Transactions, 125, pp. 514-527, (2022); Demeester, Peter, A hybrid tabu search algorithm for automatically assigning patients to beds, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 48, 1, pp. 61-70, (2010); Mazyavkina, Nina S., Reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization: A survey, Computers and Operations Research, 134, (2021); Turhan, Aykut Melih, Mixed integer programming based heuristics for the Patient Admission Scheduling problem, Computers and Operations Research, 80, pp. 38-49, (2017); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Reference point based multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms, 1, pp. 635-642, (2006); Ceschia, Sara, Dynamic patient admission scheduling with operating room constraints, flexible horizons, and patient delays, Journal of Scheduling, 19, 4, pp. 377-389, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","2073431X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129755246"

Previous research proposed an algorithm that relies on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 3 (NSGA-III), namely enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic routing algorithm (ENSGRA). This algorithm is used to optimise three objectives, which include number of worked sensors, energy consuming and node covering area. The fourth objective, which is node load balancing, is added in the current research. Such an addition aims to improve node distribution around cluster heads and decrease network congestion, thus decreasing energy consumption and increasing network lifetime. The ENSGRA algorithm is compared with multi-objective multi-step particle swarm optimisation (MOMSPSO), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA-II), and NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm ENSGRA exceed to MOMSPSO, NSGA-II, and NSGA-III in the proposed QoS model in the final outcomes, as the proposed approach achieved (38%) average combination (optimisation) percentage.

In this paper, exchange of highly sensitive information in a more transparent and secure way and to avoid the misunderstandings and trust issues between the enterprises a smart contract based on blockchain technology has been proposed in case of a distributed manufacturing environment. Here, we used a public-permission less Ethereum platform to execute the smart contracts in the Blockchain to process the customer orders and to identify the right enterprise. Later, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for optimal resource sharing and scheduling in a considered sustainable DMS. The objectives of the proposed model consist of simultaneously improvement of the performance measures such as makespan, machine utilization, energy consumption, and reliability. To solve this MILP model, a new Multi-objective-based Hybridized Moth Flame Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm (HMFEO) is developed and then the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). The results obtained from implementing the model using experimental data along with different cases show the efficiency and the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. Moreover, several performance indicators like hyper volume are increased by nearly 15–20 % that shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm with the NSGA-III. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain technology; Ethereum; Moth flame evolutionary optimization algorithm; Network-based distributed manufacturing systems; Smart contract","Energy utilization; Ethereum; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Manufacture; Scheduling; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Distributed manufacturing systems; Evolutionary optimization algorithm; Mixed integer linear programming model; Moth flame evolutionary optimization algorithm; Multi objective; Network-based; Network-based distributed manufacturing system; Resource-scheduling; Smart contract","","","This work has been funded by Department of Science and Technology, Science & En-gineering Research Board (DST-SERB), Statutory Body Established through an Act of Parliament: SERB Act 2008, Government of India with Sanction Order No ECR/2016/001808; and by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) within the RD Units Project Scope: UIDP/04077/2020 and UIDB/04077/2020 and UIDB/00319/2020.","Bin Abdullah, Nazri, Blockchain based approach to enhance big data authentication in distributed environment, International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks, ICUFN, pp. 887-892, (2017); International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology, (2016); Mansouri, Afshin Afshin, Minimizing Energy consumption and makespan in a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 67, 11, pp. 1382-1394, (2016); Al Khader, Walaa, Blockchain-based traceability and management for additive manufacturing, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 188363-188377, (2020); Angrish, Atin, A Case Study for Blockchain in Manufacturing: ""fabRec"": A Prototype for Peer-to-Peer Network of Manufacturing Nodes, Procedia Manufacturing, 26, pp. 1180-1192, (2018); Audet, Charles, Performance indicators in multiobjective optimization, European Journal of Operational Research, 292, 2, pp. 397-422, (2021); Bertolini, Massimo, Comparison of new metaheuristics, for the solution of an integrated jobs-maintenance scheduling problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 122, pp. 118-136, (2019); Bogner, Andreas, A decentralised sharing app running a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 07-09-November-2016, pp. 177-178, (2016); Mohanta, Bhabendu Kumar, Trust management in IOT enable healthcare system using ethereum based smart contract, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 8, 9, pp. 758-763, (2019); Campos, Jaime, The Challenges of Cybersecurity Frameworks to Protect Data Required for the Development of Advanced Maintenance, Procedia CIRP, 47, pp. 222-227, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","14740346","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129688259"

However, most of the existing algorithms use fixed crossover probability (pc) and mutation probability (pm) in the generation process of offspring, which makes the performance of the algorithm poor when dealing with complex problems. In this paper, by analyzing the complex non-linear relationship between performance metrics and pc and pm in the search process of many-objective evolutionary algorithms. A fuzzy inference system is constructed to dynamically update the pc and pm in the iterative process. Therefore, a fuzzy adaptive NSGA-III algorithm is proposed and used to solve large-scale optimization problems. For the construction of fuzzy systems, this paper takes the number of iterations, convergence metric, and diversity metric as inputs, and pc and pm as outputs. Four different fuzzy systems are obtained, and the best fuzzy system is selected through experiments. In order to further verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, the proposed algorithm and the existing literature are tested on LSMOP problems.

However, requirements, such as reliability, which gain new importance when alternative data is employed for credit evaluation, have not been considered as part of the credit scoring process. This research proposes an approach for incorporating context-specific stakeholder requirements in the credit scoring process. Two hybrid heuristics are proposed for a feature selection process that simultaneously optimizes all requirements. The first is a multiple objective, non-dominated sorting, binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm. The second incorporates the selection, crossover, and mutation techniques of genetic algorithms for greater diversity. Both algorithms are fitted with objective functions obtained from stakeholder requirements for multiple objective feature selection. Empirical evaluation is conducted with stakeholder requirements and alternative data features collected from mobile, public geospatial, and satellite data sources. Their performance is compared against several existing algorithms, and they offer improved performance on specific metrics. The first algorithm outperforms the existing many-objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-III, in terms of computational time, convergence, and spacing. Meanwhile, the second method results in greater spread for the same population size but has a lengthy computational time. Thus, stakeholder requirements are successfully incorporated into the feature selection process. This results in a better balance between objectives. These findings extend the research on hybrid metaheuristics for feature selection, as well as alternative data for credit scoring. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative data; Many objective optimization; Non-dominated sorting; Profit scoring; Stakeholder requirements","Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Sorting; Alternative data; Credit evaluations; Credit scoring; Features selection; Many-objective optimizations; Multiple-objectives; Non-dominated Sorting; Performance; Profit scoring; Stakeholder requirement; Population statistics","","","The authors would like to thank Agribuddy Ltd.

Usually, FS is modelled as a bi-objective optimization problem whose objectives are: 1) classification accuracy; 2) number of features. One of the main issues in real-world applications is missing data. Databases with missing data are likely to be unreliable. Thus, FS performed on a data set missing some data is also unreliable. In order to directly control this issue plaguing the field, we propose in this study a novel modelling of FS: we include reliability as the third objective of the problem. In order to address the modified problem, we propose the application of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III). We selected six incomplete data sets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. We used the mean imputation method to deal with the missing data. In the experiments, k-nearest neighbors (K-NN) is used as the classifier to evaluate the feature subsets. Experimental results show that the proposed three-objective model coupled with NSGA-III efficiently addresses the FS problem for the six data sets included in this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature selection; Missing data; Multi-objective; NSGA-III; Optimization","Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Bi-objective optimization; Classification accuracy; Imputation methods; Incomplete data sets; K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning repository; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; University of California; Classification (of information)","","","","Gheyas, Iffat A., Feature subset selection in large dimensionality domains, Pattern Recognition, 43, 1, pp. 5-13, (2010); Hancer, Emrah, Differential evolution for filter feature selection based on information theory and feature ranking, Knowledge-Based Systems, 140, pp. 103-119, (2018); Huang, Jinjie, A hybrid genetic algorithm for feature selection wrapper based on mutual information, Pattern Recognition Letters, 28, 13, pp. 1825-1844, (2007); Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Machine Learning, (1996); Subbotin, S.

In order to reduce the damage to normal tissue endangered by thermal ablation, the physician needs to plan the puncture path before surgery. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, a puncture trajectory planning method for thermal ablation of liver tumor based on NSGA-III is proposed. This method takes the clinical hard constraints and soft constraints into account. METHOD: The feasible puncture region is solved by the hard constraints, and after that the pareto front points are obtained under the soft constraints. When accessing the feasible puncture region, an adaptive morphological closing operation method based on K-means algorithm is adopted to process the spherical angle binary image of obstacles that might be encountered in the puncture process. RANSAC is performed to fit the tangent plane of liver surface when calculating the angle between the puncture trajectory and liver surface. In order to evaluate the puncture path obtained by this method, 6 tumors are selected as experimental subjects, and Hausdorff distance and Overlap Rate of Pareto front points with manually recommend points are calculated respectively. RESULTS: The average value of Hausdorff distance is 24.91 mm, and the mean value of the overlap rate is 86.43%. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can provide high safety and clinical practice of the puncture route. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","K-means; Liver tumor puncture ablation planning; multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Random Sampling Consistent algorithm","Article; comparative study; controlled study; human; human tissue; k means clustering; liver tissue; liver tumor; multiobjective optimization; puncture; radiofrequency ablation; skin surface; ablation therapy; algorithm; procedures; Ablation Techniques; Algorithms; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Punctures","","","","Zhu, Feipeng, Thermal ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma: What’s new in 2019, Chinese Clinical Oncology, 8, 6, (2019); Zhang, Rui, Computer-assisted needle trajectory planning and mathematical modeling for liver tumor thermal ablation: A review, Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, 16, 5, pp. 4846-4872, (2019); Chang, Kin Yong Stephen, Current technology in navigation and robotics for liver tumours ablation, Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore, 40, 5, pp. 231-236, (2011); Butz, Torsten, Pre-and intra-operative planning and simulation of percutaneous tumor ablation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1935, pp. 317-326, (2000); Ren, Hongliang, Coverage planning in computer-assisted ablation based on Genetic Algorithm, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 49, 1, pp. 36-45, (2014); International Society for Optics and Photonics, (2007); Essert, Caroline, Radiofrequency ablation of hepatic tumors: Simulation, planning, and contribution of virtual reality and haptics, Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, 8, 4, pp. 215-227, (2005); Medical Imaging 2009 Visualization Image Guided Procedures and Modeling, (2009); Ieee Transactions on Bio Medical Engineering, (2017); Dodd, Gerald D., Radiofrequency thermal ablation: Computer analysis of the size of the thermal injury created by overlapping ablations, American Journal of Roentgenology, 177, 4, pp. 777-782, (2001)","","IOS Press BV","","","","","","18787401; 09287329","","THCAE","35342068","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138452436"

Then, to solve the interactive optimization method that was proposed, NSGA-III was applied to obtain the Pareto front and dominance-based rough set approach to model the preference information.

The problem environment describe how the layout and number of cities involve in TSP varies over time. In this manuscript a sixteen cities DMaTSP problem is addressed with four fitness objectives: successive minimum distance between the cities, diametric minimum distance between cities and maximizing associated letters and gifts, which varies over six time periods. The paper introduce a prediction-based dynamic many-objective optimization technique termed as Dynamic θ-non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (Dθ-NSGA-III). The algorithm θ-NSGA-III, is based on the fundamentals of popular NSGA-III combined with vector angle-based evolutionary algorithm (VaEA). When a change occurs in the problem environment, the prediction set is used to generate the new population, to achieve faster convergence to the new global optimum. Four prediction strategies based on support vector regression (SVR) with linear kernel and radial basis function (RBF) kernel, polynomial interpolation, and cubic spline-based prediction are used for analysis. The validation of the Dθ-NSGA-III algorithm has been carried out on sixteen benchmark functions taken from DIMP, G, JY and DF Test suites. Comparative analysis have been carried out with dynamic algorithms of NSGA-III, MOEA/D, MRP-MOEA and DNSGA-II algorithms. The simulation analysis reveals superior performance of Dθ-NSGA-III with RBF kernel over the benchmark test suites as well as DMaTSP problem in the form of Mean of IGD, Shott's Spacing, Max. Spread metrics.

Generally, different solution-sorting methods possess different advantages in dealing with distinct MaOPs. Focusing on this characteristic, this article proposes a general voting-mechanism-based ensemble framework (VMEF), where different solution-sorting methods can be integrated and work cooperatively to select promising solutions in a more robust manner. In addition, a strategy is designed to calculate the contribution of each solution-sorting method and then the total votes are adaptively allocated to different solution-sorting methods according to their contribution. Solution-sorting methods that make more contribution to the optimization process are rewarded with more votes and the solution-sorting methods with poor contribution will be punished in a period of time, which offers a good feedback to the optimization process. Finally, to test the performance of VMEF, extensive experiments are conducted in which VMEF is compared with five state-of-the-art peer many-objective EAs, including NSGA-III, SPEA/R, hpaEA, BiGE, and grid-based evolutionary algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of VMEF is significantly better than that of these comparative algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ensemble framework; evolutionary optimization; many-objective optimization; solution-sorting methods; voting","Optimization; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Five state; Grid-based; Many-objective optimizations; Sorting method; Voting mechanism; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","Karahan, Ibrahim, A territory defining multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and preference incorporation, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 14, 4, pp. 636-664, (2010); Chen, Huangke, Uncertainty-Aware Online Scheduling for Real-Time Workflows in Cloud Service Environment, IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, 14, 4, pp. 1167-1178, (2021); Fleming, P.

In general, capacity and delay are often used as indicators to improve intersection effi-ciency, but auxiliary indicators such as vehicle emissions that contribute to sustainable traffic development also need to be considered. It is necessary to evaluate intersection traffic efficiency through multiple measures to reflect different aspects of traffic, and these measures may conflict with each other. Therefore, this paper studies a multi‐objective urban traffic signal timing problem, which re-quires a reasonable signal timing parameter under a given traffic flow condition, to better take into account the traffic capacity, delay and exhaust emission index of the intersection. Firstly, based on the traffic flow as the basic data, combined with the traffic flow description theory and exhaust emission estimation rules, a multi‐objective model of signal timing problem is established. Sec-ondly, the target model is solved and tested by the genetic algorithm of non‐dominated sorting framework. It is found that the Pareto solution set of traffic indicators obtained by NSGA‐III has a larger domain. Finally, the search mechanism of evolutionary algorithm is essentially uncon-strained, while the actual traffic signal timing problem is constrained by traffic environment. In order to obtain a better signal timing scheme, this paper introduces the method of combining hybrid constraint strategy and NSGA‐III framework, abbreviated as HCNSGA‐III. The simulation experi-ment was carried out based on the same target model. The simulated results were compared with the actual scheme and the timing scheme obtained in recent research. The results show that the indices of traffic capacity, delay and exhaust emission obtained by the proposed method have more obvious advantages. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithm; Intersection; Multi‐objective; NSGA‐III; Signal timing","exhaust emission; genetic algorithm; model; optimization; road traffic; simulation; traffic congestion","","","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61272509 and 61801005), Shaanxi Province Hundred Talents Program, and the key research and development plan of Shaanxi province (No.2021GY‐072), Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi province (No.2020JQ‐903).","China Transp Rev, (2018); 68 of the World Population Projected to Live in Urban Areas by 2050; Wang, Yizhe, A review of the self-adaptive traffic signal control system based on future traffic environment, Journal of Advanced Transportation, 2018, (2018); Chen, Guoqian, Global overview for energy use of the world economy: Household-consumption-based accounting based on the world input-output database (WIOD), Energy Economics, 81, pp. 835-847, (2019); Proceedings of the Second United Nations Global Sustainable Transport Conference, (2021); Liu, Shiyong, A framework for evaluating the dynamic impacts of a congestion pricing policy for a transportation socioeconomic system, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 44, 8, pp. 596-608, (2010); Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways; Chen, Peng, Comparison of Variability of Individual Vehicle Delay and Average Control Delay at Signalized Intersections, Transportation Research Record, 2553, 1, pp. 128-137, (2016); Traffic Signal Timing Operations Strategies; Zhao, Dongbin, Computational intelligence in urban traffic signal control: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews, 42, 4, pp. 485-494, (2012)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123536681"

However, as far as we know, this problem has not been considered yet in previous literature. The scheduling scale of this problem is large, and it is difficult to coordinate and optimize the scheduling of each workshop. The existing optimization algorithms cannot consider simultaneously convergence and diversity when solving the Ma-ODFJCSP. To solve this problem, firstly, we establish a many-objective distributed flexible job shop collaborative scheduling model. The scheduling objectives of the scheduling model simultaneously optimize the economic indicators and green indicators. To solve the model effectively, a high-dimensional many-objective memetic algorithm (HMOMA) is proposed. This method combines the improved NSGA-III and local search method. To effectively expand the solution set space, the neighborhood structure based on collaborative adjustment of process and equipment and based on the critical path are designed. To enhance the comprehensive performance of the population, a dual-mode environment selection method is proposed. The feasibility and competitiveness of the scheduling model and HMOMA are verified by experiment.

Presently, the imbalanced binary classification approach based on deep learning has achieved good results and gets more attention constantly. In this study, we present a dual encoder (Denoising Auto-Encoder) DAE neural network based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and generative adversarial network (GAN) to address the imbalanced binary classification problem. The primary aim of our approach is to increase the separability between the reconstruction error of minority class latent features and the reconstruction error of majority class latent features. For this purpose, we first create a dual encoder DAE network to obtain the reconstruction error of latent features of training data. Second, when training the neural network, we introduced GAN to perform a layer-wise training which can improve the training effect of the model. Third, in order to increase the separability of the reconstruction error of minority class and majority class, we utilize NSGA-III to optimize the parameters of the second encoder. Then, we can obtain a set of non-dominated solutions. Finally, based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, we can get the best solution, which is the most appropriate parameter set of the second encoder to distinguish the minority class and the majority class. The experiment results on both benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset for communication anomaly detection demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in imbalanced binary classification problem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Denoising auto-encoder; GAN; Imbalanced data; NSGA-III","","","","This work was partially supported by the Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by Henan Association for Science and Technology, China under Grant No. 2020HYTP008.","Zhu, Honghao, Optimizing Weighted Extreme Learning Machines for imbalanced classification and application to credit card fraud detection, Neurocomputing, 407, pp. 50-62, (2020); Bauder, Richard A., The effects of varying class distribution on learner behavior for medicare fraud detection with imbalanced big data, Health Information Science and Systems, 6, 1, (2018); Jiang, Xinxin, Cost-Sensitive Parallel Learning Framework for Insurance Intelligence Operation, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 66, 12, pp. 9713-9723, (2019); Chang, Temin, Hybrid segmentation strategy and multi-agent svms for corporate risk management in class imbalanced situations, Journal of Testing and Evaluation, 44, 3, pp. 1364-1375, (2016); Sun, Jie, Dynamic prediction of relative financial distress based on imbalanced data stream: from the view of one industry, Risk Management, 21, 4, pp. 215-242, (2019); Huang, Xun, Predicting Extreme Financial Risks on Imbalanced Dataset: A Combined Kernel FCM and Kernel SMOTE Based SVM Classifier, Computational Economics, 56, 1, pp. 187-216, (2020); Variational Autoencoder Based Anomaly Detection Using Reconstruction Probability, (2015); Schlegl, Thomas, Unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks to guide marker discovery, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10265 LNCS, pp. 146-147, (2017); Efficient Gan Based Anomaly Detection Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, (1802); Akçay, Samet, GANomaly: Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Training, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11363 LNCS, pp. 622-637, (2019)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14337541; 1433755X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117091440"

This Big data largely consists of semi-structured and unstructured data, which needs to be processed in admissible time so that timely decisions are taken that benefit the organization and society. Such real time processing would require Big data view materialization that would enable faster and timely processing of decision making queries. Several algorithms exist for Big data view materialization. These algorithms aim to select Big data views that minimize the total query processing cost for the query workload. In literature, this problem has been articulated as a bi-objective optimization problem, which minimizes the query evaluation cost along with the update processing cost. This paper proposes to adapt the reference point based nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, to design an NSGA-III based Big data view selection algorithm (BDVSANSGA-III) to address this bi-objective Big data view selection problem. Experimental results revealed that the proposed BDVSANSGA-III was able to compute diverse non-dominated Big data views and performed better than the existing algorithms.. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Decision Making; Multi-Objective Optimization; NSGA-III; View Materialization","Big data; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Application process; Decisions makings; Large amounts of data; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; NSGA-III; Processing costs; Semistructured data; Unstructured data; View materializations; Decision making","","","","Agrawal, Sanjay, Automated selection of materialized views and indexes for SQL databases, pp. 496-505, (2000); Araujo, Theo B., In AI we trust?

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, like Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multi-objective Particle Swamp Optimization (MOPSO), have proved helpful in solving Controller Placement Problem (CPP) in SD-WAN. However, these algorithms were associated with the challenge of scalability (when there are more than three objectives) for optimization in the SD-WAN. Hence, this study proposed an adapted NSGA-III (A-NSGA-III) to resolve the scalability challenges associated with NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms in the presence of more than three objectives. This study developed and introduced a repair-based operator into the existing Mechanical Engineering based NSGA-III to propose the A-NSGA-III for optimal controller placement in the SD-WAN. The proposed A-NSGA-III, the NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms were subjected to evaluation using datasets from Internet2 OS3E WAN topology with six objective functions. The Hypervolume indicator, Percentage Coefficient of Variation (PCV), the percentage difference and the Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCP) confirmed that the proposed A-NSGA-III exhibited high convergence and diversification than the NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms in the presence of scalability challenge (when the number of objective function exceeded three). The result confirmed that the proposed A-NSGA-III solved the scalability challenges associated with the optimal Controller Placement in the SD-WAN.

Six indices: the Voltage Collapse Proximity Index (VCPI), Line Voltage Stability Index (LVSI), Line Stability Index (Lmn), Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI), Line Stability Factor (LQP), and Novel Line Stability Index (NLSI) were considered as case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus consisting of thermal, wind, solar and hybrid wind-hydro generators. A multiobjective evaluation using the multiobjective mayfly algorithm (MOMA) was performed in two operational scenarios: normal and contingency conditions, using the MATLAB-MATPOWER toolbox. Fuzzy Decision-Making technique was used to determine the best compromise solutions for each Pareto front. To evaluate the computational efficiency of the case studies, a preference selection index was used. The results indicate that VCPI and NLSI yielded the best-optimized system performance in minimizing generation costs, transmission loss reduction, and simulation time for normal and contingency conditions. The best-case studies also promoted the most scheduled reactive power generation from renewable energy sources (RES). On average, the VCPI index contributed the highest penetration level from RES (13.40%), while the Lmn index had the lowest. Overall, VCPI and Lmn index provided the best and worst average performance in both operating scenarios, respectively. Also, the MOMA algorithm demonstrated superior performance against the multiobjective harris hawks algorithm (MHHO), multiobjective Jaya algorithm (MOJAYA), multiobjective particle swarm algorithm (MOPSO), and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) algorithms. In all, the proposed approach yields the lowest system cost and loss compared to other methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Acoustic generators; Computational efficiency; Decision making; Electric power transmission; Genetic algorithms; MATLAB; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Screening; Stability; Stochastic systems; Case-studies; Condition; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimal power flow; Performance; Renewable energy source; Stability indices; Thermal winds; Voltage collapse proximity; Voltage-stability index; Electric load flow","","","","Abdollahi, Arsalan, Optimal power flow incorporating facts devices and stochastic wind power generation using krill herd algorithm, Electronics (Switzerland), 9, 6, pp. 1-18, (2020); Zaheb, Hameedullah, A contemporary novel classification of voltage stability indices, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 5, (2020); Adewuyi, Oludamilare Bode, Comparative analysis of a new VSC-optimal power flow formulation for power system security planning, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 30, 3, (2020); Hassan, Mohamed H., A modified rao‐2 algorithm for optimal power flow incorporating renewable energy sources, Mathematics, 9, 13, (2021); Pandya, Sundaram Bharatbhai, Renewable energy resources integrated multi-objective optimal power flow using non-dominated sort grey wolf optimizer, Journal of Green Engineering, 10, 1, pp. 180-205, (2020); Kyomugisha, Rebeccah, Multiobjective optimal power flow for static voltage stability margin improvement, Heliyon, 7, 12, (2021); Khunkitti, Sirote, A comparison of the effectiveness of voltage stability indices in an optimal power flow, IEEJ Transactions on Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 14, 4, pp. 534-544, (2019); Thasnas, Natakorn, Implementation of Static Line Voltage Stability Indices for Improved Static Voltage Stability Margin, Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2019, (2019); Estanqueiro, A.

The experimental results on 24 problem instances (including six real-world instances) show that the developed SPS model reduces project duration by 40% while being within budget. The results provide evidence that consideration of experience evolution while tasks reallocation under dynamic events significantly optimizes project schedules.

Based on the study of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) idea, a hyperspectral image reconstruction algorithm based on reference point nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) is proposed. Instead of directly reconstructing the entire hyperspectral data as a traditional OMP reconstruction algorithm, the proposed algorithm explores the idea of the evolution process in the reconstruction. The Gabor redundancy dictionary is established as the sparse basis of hyperspectral images, and the reconstruction model of multiobjective optimization is constructed. In the reconstruction process, the NSGA-III algorithm is used to find the optimal atoms to represent the original signal, and Hermitian inversion lemma is also used to realize the recursive update of the residuals. The initial solution generation, the definition of reference points, the association and niche-preservation operation, and the crossover and mutation operation in NSGA-III are presented in detail. Experimental results on hyperspectral data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could maintain the reconstruction accuracy, as well as the computational efficiency, and are superior to the state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. The proposed algorithm could be applied in the classification and unmixing in hyperspectral images. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Computational efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Hyperspectral imaging; Image reconstruction; Multiobjective optimization; Sorting; Hyperspectral Data; Image reconstruction algorithm; Images reconstruction; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Reconstruction algorithms; Reference points; Spatial features; Spectral feature; Spectroscopy","","","","Freitas, Sara, Remote hyperspectral imaging acquisition and characterization for marine litter detection, Remote Sensing, 13, 13, (2021); Hong, Danfeng, Graph Convolutional Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 59, 7, pp. 5966-5978, (2021); Xue, Jize, Spatial-Spectral Structured Sparse Low-Rank Representation for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 30, pp. 3084-3097, (2021); Shevkunov, Igor A., Spectral object recognition in hyperspectral holography with complex-domain denoising, Sensors, 19, 23, (2019); Zare, Marzieh, Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion using coupled non-negative tucker tensor decomposition, Remote Sensing, 13, 15, (2021); Hao, Qiaobo, Fusing Multiple Deep Models for in Vivo Human Brain Hyperspectral Image Classification to Identify Glioblastoma Tumor, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 70, (2021); Donoho, David L., Compressed sensing, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52, 4, pp. 1289-1306, (2006); Candés, Emmanuel J., Robust uncertainty principles: Exact signal reconstruction from highly incomplete frequency information, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 52, 2, pp. 489-509, (2006); Dworak, Volker, Hyperspectral imaging tera hertz system for soil analysis: Initial results, Sensors, 20, 19, pp. 1-22, (2020); Baraniuk, Richard G., A simple proof of the restricted isometry property for random matrices, Constructive Approximation, 28, 3, pp. 253-263, (2008)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","1875905X; 1574017X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128736542"

Location-based advertising (LBA) are utilized for abandoning the user location and to offer assistance by using the obtained information.

Initially, the potential location information is evaluated utilizing the geographic information system (GIS). Thereafter, significant features are computed using the location data. Obtained features are then segmented to improve the process of LBS. Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is then utilized to efficiently classify the user data. Finally, the optimization of classified documents is achieved using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III). Extensive experiments are performed to validate GANM for LBS.

The motivation of this paper is to select the most suitable catalog of MG from DC micro-grid (DC-MG), AC micro-grid (AC-MG), and hybrid MG by means of uncertainties' models and corresponding DGs' configurations. The DGs in all catalogs of MG are composed of wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV), biomass generation (BG), and battery energy storage (BES) system. In terms of uncertainties' models, the proposed mathematical models are combined with multifarious scenarios which are considered the uncertainties of variations in solar irradiance and wind speed, temperature, and load demand. Particularly, this paper also proposes differences in allocations and sizes of all the equipment based on the assumed specific structure for each catalog of MG. Then, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is utilized by MATLAB working platform to compute the multi-objective functions associating with the minimized system cost, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for each catalog of MG. Finally, the results and comparisons demonstrate that the AC-MG is the optimal catalog for the case study, which has superiorities of economy and reliability.

The devices connected to the network must be controlled by the manager. For this purpose, many schemes are proposed to identify IoT devices, especially the schemes working on the gateway. However, almost all researchers do not pay close attention to the cost. Thus, considering the gateway's limited storage and computational resources, a new lightweight IoT device identification scheme is proposed. First, the DFI (deep/dynamic flow inspection) technology is utilized to efficiently extract flow-related statistical features based on in-depth studies. Then, combined with symmetric uncertainty and correlation coefficient, we proposed a novel filter feature selection method based on NSGA-III to select effective features for IoT device identification. We evaluate our proposed method by using a real smart home IoT data set and three different ML algorithms. The experimental results showed that our proposed method is lightweight and the feature selection algorithm is also effective, only using 6 features can achieve 99.5% accuracy with a 3-minute time interval. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Automation; Digital storage; Feature extraction; Gateways (computer networks); Computational resources; Dynamic flows; Feature-based; Flow features; Identification scheme; In-depth study; Inspection technology; Limited storage; Statistical features; Storage resources; Internet of things","","","","Internet of Things Connected Means Informed, (2020); Riahi, Arbia, A roadmap for security challenges in the Internet of Things, Digital Communications and Networks, 4, 2, pp. 118-137, (2018); Khan, Minhaj Ahmad, IoT security: Review, blockchain solutions, and open challenges, Future Generation Computer Systems, 82, pp. 395-411, (2018); Annual Cybersecurity Report, (2018); Griffioen, Harm J., Examining Mirai's Battle over the Internet of Things, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 743-755, (2020); Huang, Yong, Authenticating On-Body IoT Devices: An Adversarial Learning Approach, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 19, 8, pp. 5234-5245, (2020); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Jain, Himanshu, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point based nondominated sorting approach, Part II: Handling constraints and extending to an adaptive approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 602-622, (2014); Feng, Xuan, Acquisitional rule-based engine for discovering Internet-of-Thing devices, pp. 327-341, (2018); Miettinen, Markus, IoT SENTINEL: Automated Device-Type Identification for Security Enforcement in IoT, Proceedings - International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, pp. 2177-2184, (2017)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","19390114; 19390122","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124022552"

Furthermore, in both portfolio problems, we quantify the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Proximity Measure (KKTPM) for each generation to determine how far we are from the effective front and to provide knowledge about the Pareto optimal solution. In the portfolio problem, looking for the optimal set of stock or assets that maximizes the mean return and minimizes the risk factor.

In addition, climate variation makes the selection of these parameters more complex. The paper aims to establish guidelines for determining a single-family household’s unique optimal passive design in various climate zones worldwide. For this purpose, a bi-objective optimization is performed for twenty-four locations in twenty climates by coupling TRNSYS and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) using the Python program. The optimization process generates Pareto fronts of thermal load and investment cost to identify the optimum design options for the insulation level of the envelope, window aperture for passive cooling, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), shading fraction, radiation-based shading control, and building orientation. The goal is to find a feasible tradeoff between thermal energy demand and the cost of thermal insulation. This is achieved using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) through criteria importance using intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The results demonstrate that an optimal envelope design remarkably improves the thermal load compared to the base case of previous envelope design practices. However, the weather conditions strongly influence the design parameters. The research findings set a benchmark for energy-efficient household envelopes in the investigated climates. The optimal solution sets also provide a criterion for selecting the ranges of envelope design parameters according to the space heating and cooling demands of the climate zone. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building envelope; Climate zone; CRITIC; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Residential building; TOPSIS; TRNSYS","building; decision making; design method; genetic algorithm; investment; optimization; parameter estimation; residential location; technical efficiency","","","","Energy Technology Perspectives 2020, (2020); Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, (2020); International Energy Outlook, (2005); Energy Technology Perspectives, (2008); Far, Claire, Improving energy efficiency of existing residential buildings using effective thermal retrofit of building envelope, Indoor and Built Environment, 28, 6, pp. 744-760, (2019); Méndez Echenagucia, Tomás, The early design stage of a building envelope: Multi-objective search through heating, cooling and lighting energy performance analysis, Applied Energy, 154, pp. 577-591, (2015); Yu, Wei, Application of multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize energy efficiency and thermal comfort in building design, Energy and Buildings, 88, pp. 135-143, (2015); Yong, Seokgil, Impacts of building envelope design factors upon energy loads and their optimization in US standard climate zones using experimental design, Energy and Buildings, 141, pp. 1-15, (2017); Guo, Yuang, Optimization of design parameters for office buildings with climatic adaptability based on energy demand and thermal comfort, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2020); Woolley, Jonathan M., Side-by-side laboratory comparison of radiant and all-air cooling: How natural ventilation cooling and heat gain characteristics impact space heat extraction rates and daily thermal energy use, Energy and Buildings, 200, pp. 68-85, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121756283"

The sensor selection is known to be an NP-hard problem. Thus, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can be incorporated to solve the sensor selection problem in IoT systems. Previously, researchers have been working on sensor selection problems with two or three objectives. Recently, this problem is formulated as a many-objective optimization problem and solved using a Decomposition-based Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA/D). In this paper, we consider the sensor selection problem as a many-objective problem with 5 objectives. To accelerate the convergence, we incorporate Opposition Based Learning (OBL) in the general framework of MOEA/D. Furthermore, we use a well-known many-objective algorithm known as the Non-dominated Sorting based Genetic Algorithm incorporated with OBL (NSGA-III/OBL) to enhance its convergence and diversity. The experimental results show that NSGA-III/OBL outperforms all other compared algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Many-objective optimization; Metaheuristics; Opposition based learning; Optimization; Sensors selection in IoT","Computational complexity; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Many-objective optimizations; Metaheuristic; Non-dominated Sorting; Opposition-based learning; Optimisations; Physical objects; Sensor device; Sensor selection; Sensor selection in internet of thing; Sensor selection problem; Internet of things","","","","Bian, Fang, Utility-based sensor selection, 2006, pp. 11-18, (2006); Damuut, Luhutyit Peter, A mixed genetic algorithm strategy to sensor selection problem in WSNs, pp. 94-100, (2013); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Li, Wei, Learning-based elephant herding optimization algorithm for solving numerical optimization problems, Knowledge-Based Systems, 195, (2020); Wang, Tiejun, Adaptive dynamic disturbance strategy for differential evolution algorithm, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 6, (2020); Narayanan, Swathi Jamjala, Fuzzy decision trees embedded with evolutionary fuzzy clustering for locating users using wireless signal strength in an indoor environment, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 36, 8, pp. 4280-4297, (2021); Ma, Haiping, Multi-population techniques in nature inspired optimization algorithms: A comprehensive survey, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 44, pp. 365-387, (2019); Huang, Zhenqiu, An energy sentient methodology for sensor mapping and selection in IoT systems, IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, pp. 1436-1441, (2014); Yu, Shihyuan, QoS oriented sensor selection in IoT system, pp. 201-206, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00457906","","CPEEB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120623238"

Therefore, it is of great significance to study the solving method for IMaOPS. However, there are fewer solving methods due to the uncertain interval of the objective function. In this paper, an improved NSGA-III algorithm (named LFOA-NSGA-III) is proposed to effectively solve these problems. Due to the uncertain interval in the IMaOPs, the original NSGA-III algorithm can ineffectively evaluate the relationship between the interval solution set and the reference point. So the matter-element extension model is introduced, which can make the optimized solution set close to the Pareto optimal solution. Furthermore, in order to improve the optimization performance and population diversity of the improved algorithm, the K-mean algorithm is used to solve the initial solution set, as well as a local fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) is combined with the genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, the LFOA-NSGA-III algorithm is empirically evaluated on eleven interval benchmark test problems and an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) path planning problem. Through simulation comparisons with other different algorithms, it is concluded that the hyper-volume value, the imprecision value and the IGD value indicators are significantly better than other comparison algorithms. In addition, from a simulation experiment in application of the multi-UAVs path planning problem, it can be seen that the LFOA-NSGA-III algorithm is more effective and applicative in the IMaOPs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fruit fly optimization algorithm; Interval; Many-objective optimization; Matter-element extension model; NSGA-III algorithm","Antennas; Benchmarking; Fruits; K-means clustering; Motion planning; Pareto principle; Extension models; Fly optimization algorithms; Fruit fly optimization algorithm; Fruitflies; Interval; Many-objective optimizations; Matter-element; Matter-element extension model; NSGA-III algorithm; Optimization problems; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was supported by the LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program, China ( XLYC2007091 ) and Joint open fund project of State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Safety Technology of Liaoning Province, China ( 2020-KF-13-04 ).","Niu, Xinsong, A combined model based on data preprocessing strategy and multi-objective optimization algorithm for short-term wind speed forecasting, Applied Energy, 241, pp. 519-539, (2019); Zhang, Honghao, A hybrid multi-objective optimization approach for energy-absorbing structures in train collisions, Information Sciences, 481, pp. 491-506, (2019); Hu, Jianming, A novel wind power probabilistic forecasting approach based on joint quantile regression and multi-objective optimization, Renewable Energy, 149, pp. 141-164, (2020); Li, Gui, DLEA: A dynamic learning evolution algorithm for many-objective optimization, Information Sciences, 574, pp. 567-589, (2021); Szłapczyńska, Joanna, Preference-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization in ship weather routing, Applied Soft Computing, 84, (2019); Zhou, Jiajun, Hyperplane-driven and projection-assisted search for solving many-objective optimization problems, Information Sciences, 574, pp. 394-412, (2021); Wen, Shuli, Allocation of ESS by interval optimization method considering impact of ship swinging on hybrid PV/diesel ship power system, Applied Energy, 175, pp. 158-167, (2016); Li, Yuanzheng, Multi-objective optimal dispatch of microgrid under uncertainties via interval optimization, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 10, 2, pp. 2046-2058, (2019); Zhang, Yong, Fuzzy cost-based feature selection using interval multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 31, 6, pp. 2807-2812, (2016); Liu, Tan, Multi-objective optimization method using an improved NSGA-II algorithm for oil-gas production process, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers, 57, pp. 42-53, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15684946","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120435801"

Two improvements, called Bias and Weighted (BW) niche-preservation and Information Gain (IG)-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) prioritizing, are further designed in FS-MOEA. The former is used to counterbalance the imbalanced problem in datasets by assigning rare classes higher priorities, while the latter is employed to search the optimal feature subset for FS-MOEA. In IG-AHP prioritizing, a more distinct measurement, i.e. average IG, is used as the dominant factor to guide the decision analysis of AHP.

For this, we propose a new mathematical modeling in which the goal is to maximize the total energy production of the hydro-power plant in a sub-daily operation, and, simultaneously, to maximize the total water content (volume) of reservoirs. For solving the problem, we discuss the Multi-objective Evolutionary Swarm Hybridization (MESH) algorithm, a recently proposed multi-objective swarm intelligence-based optimization method which has obtained very competitive results when compared to existing evolutionary algorithms in specific applications. The MESH approach has been applied to find the optimal water discharge and the power produced at the maximum reservoir volume for all possible combinations of turbines in a hydro-power plant. The performance of MESH has been compared with that of well-known evolutionary approaches such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA2, and MOEA/D in a realistic problem considering data from a hydro-power energy system with two cascaded hydro-power plants in Brazil. Results indicate that MESH showed a superior performance than alternative multi-objective approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy, providing a profit of $412,500 per month in a projection analysis carried out. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cascading hydro-power plant modeling; Energy production; MESH; Multi-objective optimization; Swarm intelligence","Evolutionary algorithms; Hydroelectric power plants; Mesh generation; Multiobjective optimization; Reservoirs (water); Swarm intelligence; Cascading hydro-power plant modeling; Energy productions; Evolutionary approach; Hybridisation; Hydro power; Hydropower plants; Multi-objective evolutionary; Multi-objective evolutionary swarm hybridization; Multi-objectives optimization; Multi-reservoir systems; Hydroelectric power","","","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 754382 .

However, most of the previous studies focused more on efficiency and ignored energy consumption. Energy, especially non-renewable energy, is an essential factor affecting the sustainable development of a country. To this end, this paper designs a flexible job shop scheduling problem model with energy consideration more in line with the production field. Except for the processing stage, the energy consumption of the transport, set up, unload, and idle stage are also included in our model. The weight property of jobs is also considered in our model. The heavier the job, the more energy it consumes during the transport, set up, and unload stage. Meanwhile, this paper invents an adaptive population non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (APNSGA-III) that combines the dual control strategy with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) to solve our flexible job shop scheduling problem model. Four flexible job shop scheduling problem instances are formulated to examine the performance of our algorithm. The results achieved by the APNSGA-III method are compared with five classic multi-objective optimization algorithms. The results show that our proposed algorithm is efficient and powerful when dealing with the multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem model that includes energy consumption. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dual control strategy; Energy consumption; Flexible job shop scheduling problem; Makespan; NSGA-III","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFB1700500) and the National Science Foundation of China under grants (52077213 and 62003332).; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was funded by [National Key R&D Program of China] grant number [2018YFB1700500] and [National Science Foundation of China under grants] grant number [52077213 and 62003332].

However, when there are many obstacles, the path can easily violate constraints during the evolutionary process. Even if a single waypoint causes a few constraint violations, the algorithm will discard these solutions. In this paper, path planning is constructed as a multi-objective optimization problem with constraints in a three-dimensional terrain scenario. To solve this problem in an effective way, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm based on multi-level constraint processing (ANSGA-III-PPS) to plan the shortest collision-free flight path of a gliding UAV. The proposed algorithm uses an adaptive constraint processing mechanism to improve different path constraints in a three-dimensional environment and uses an improved adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (third edition—ANSGA-III) to enhance the algorithm’s path planning ability in a complex environment. The experimental results show that compared with the other four algorithms, ANSGA-III-PPS achieves the best solution performance. This not only validates the effect of the proposed algorithm, but also enriches and improves the research results of UAV path planning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs); Constrained optimization; Evolutionary algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Adaptive algorithms; Aeroassist; Aircraft accidents; Genetic algorithms; Motion planning; Multiobjective optimization; Multitasking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Constrained multi-objective optimization problem; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Constraint processing; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Multi-stages; Optimisations; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle path planning; Constrained optimization","","","This research was funded by Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Software Engineering of Yunnan Province, grant no. 2020SE308, 2020SE309.","Aggarwal, Shubhani, Path planning techniques for unmanned aerial vehicles: A review, solutions, and challenges, Computer Communications, 149, pp. 270-299, (2020); Chen, Hai, A survey of autonomous control for UAV, 2, pp. 267-271, (2009); Zhao, Yijing, Survey on computational-intelligence-based UAV path planning, Knowledge-Based Systems, 158, pp. 54-64, (2018); Radmanesh, Mohammadreza, Overview of Path-Planning and Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms for UAVs: A Comparative Study, Unmanned Systems, 6, 2, pp. 95-118, (2018); Ma, Yong, Multi-objective path planning for unmanned surface vehicle with currents effects, ISA Transactions, 75, pp. 137-156, (2018); Qu, Chengzhi, A novel reinforcement learning based grey wolf optimizer algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) path planning, Applied Soft Computing, 89, (2020); Li, Ziqiang, A hybrid multi-mechanism optimization approach for the payload packing design of a satellite module, Applied Soft Computing, 45, pp. 11-26, (2016); Golabi, Mahmoud, Bypassing or flying above the obstacles?

However, due to the CMOS technology downscaling, along the very large number of design variables and their trade-offs, it results difficult to reach target specifications without the application of optimization methods. For this reason, this work shows the advantages of performing many-objective optimization and this algorithm is compared to the well-known mono-and multi-objective metaheuristics, which have demonstrated their usefulness in sizing CMOS ICs. Three CMOS operational transconductance amplifiers are the case study in this work; they were sized by applying mono-, multi-and many-objective algorithms. The well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm version 3 (NSGA-III) and the many-objective metaheuristic-based on the R2 indicator (MOMBI-II) were applied to size CMOS amplifiers and their sized solutions were compared to mono-and multiobjective algorithms. The CMOS amplifiers were optimized considering five targets, associated to a figure of merit (FoM), differential gain, power consumption, common-mode rejection ratio and total silicon area. The designs were performed using UMC 180 nm CMOS technology. To show the advantage of applying many-objective optimization algorithms to size CMOS amplifiers, the amplifier with the best performance was used to design a fractional-order integrator based on OTA-C filters. A variation analysis considering the process, the voltage and temperature (PVT) and a Monte Carlo analysis were performed to verify design robustness. Finally, the OTA-based fractional-order integrator was used to design a fractional-order chaotic oscillator, showing good agreement between numerical and SPICE simulations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CMOS operational transconductance amplifier; Differential evolution; Fractional-order chaotic oscillator; Fractional-order integrator; Many optimizing liaison; Many-objective metaheuristic based on the R2 indicator; Monte Carlo; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm; Particle swarm optimization; PVT analyses","","","","","Tlelo-Cuautle, Esteban, Sizing cmos amplifiers by pso and mol to improve dc operating point conditions, Electronics (Switzerland), 9, 6, pp. 1-19, (2020); Devi, Swagata, Metaheuristic algorithms-based approach for optimal design of improvised fully differential amplifier for biomedical applications, pp. 605-609, (2021); Rashid, Ria, Hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm for area minimization in 65 nm technology, Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2021-May, (2021); Ben, Yuejing, Applying design equations in particle swarm optimization for auto-sizing of multi-stage opamps: an experimental study, Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, 103, 1, pp. 117-130, (2020); Li, Chuan, Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization for High-Efficiency Power Amplifier Design, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 69, 5, pp. 2494-2505, (2021); Lberni, Abdelaziz, Efficient butterfly inspired optimization algorithm for analog circuits design, Microelectronics Journal, 113, (2021); Kumar, Ram, Parameter optimization of 5.5 GHz low noise amplifier using multi-objective Firefly Algorithm, Microsystem Technologies, 26, 10, pp. 3289-3297, (2020); Mostafa, Sheikh Shanawaz, Analog active filter design using a multi objective genetic algorithm, AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications, 93, pp. 83-94, (2018); Papadimitriou, Angelos, Multi-objective Low-Noise Amplifier Optimization Using Analytical Model and Genetic Computation, Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing, 36, 12, pp. 4963-4993, (2017); Abi, Soufiane, An Optimal Design of a Short-Channel RF Low Noise Amplifier Using a Swarm Intelligence Technique, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1076, pp. 143-153, (2020)","","MDPI","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121315374"

Further, different decision makers may have different preferences towards the degree of risk they tend to accept in their decisions. We contribute to the literature by developing a risk-averse multi-objective optimization model to determine the appropriate settings of recruitment, promotion and fleet transition strategies that simultaneously minimize the weighted sum of expected and Conditional-Value-at-Risk values of several objectives. In this study, we consider three objectives, namely, workforce cost (WC), capability gap (CG) (defined as the unavailability of assets due to workforce shortages to crew assets) and capital and sustainment cost (CSC) of assets. To solve this problem, we develop a simulation–optimization method integrated with Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as a hybrid solution approach. The simulation–optimization method combines Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) III and a System Dynamics (SD) simulation model. In an iterative process, NSGA-III generates the recruitment, promotion and fleet transition strategies and the SD simulation model evaluates the fitness of the generated strategies by calculating the values of three objectives. The output of the simulation–optimization method is a set of Pareto optimal solutions and the corresponding Pareto fronts.

First, gear optimization using macro design variables was performed, excluding tooth addendum and dedendum parameters. Subsequently, the optimization, including the addendum and dedendum variables, was performed by applying the same addendum and dedendum lengths to the pinion and wheel. Finally, the gear optimization using different addendum and dedendum lengths for the pinion and wheel was completed. The gear mass, gear mesh efficiency, and transmission errors were considered as objective functions for optimization. The optimization results were min-max normalized, and the average values of the total scores were compared. The results show that the average score of the optimization considering only the main design variables was 2.7085 points and that considering the addendum and dedendum was 2.7829 and 2.8830 points, respectively, from a maximum possible score of 3.000 points.

A Blood supply chain (BSC) network is an especial case of the general supply chain usually investigated using single or multi-objective approaches. However, there are always many incompatible targets for this problem in the real world. This paper aims to deal with the problem of BSC network design in emergencies using a six-objective optimization framework. Such a model can appropriately meet and balance the expectations of different stakeholders and the BSC network, considering the immediate and dynamic requirements of a specific emergency event. To formulate the problem at hand, a new mathematical model is developed as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) model. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, two recently developed solution algorithms called NSGA-III and FR-NSGA-II are adapted and used to solve the problem in a reasonable time. The proposed solution algorithms provide some proper trade-offs between different objectives that can be valuable for related managers. The result shows that a more stable Pareto-optimal solution can be produced using the FR-NSGA-II. Supplementary analysis indicates the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the previous studies in BSC network design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blood substitution preferences; Blood supply chain; Facility location and allocation; FR-NSGA-II; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III","Blood; Integer programming; NP-hard; Pareto principle; Supply chains; Many-objective optimizations; Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP); New mathematical model; Objective optimization; Pareto optimal solutions; Real-world problem; Solution algorithms; Strongly NP-hard; Economic and social effects","","","","Arvan, Meysam, Designing a bi-objective, multi-product supply chain network for blood supply, Uncertain Supply Chain Management, 3, 1, pp. 57-68, (2015); Beliën, Jeroen, Supply chain management of blood products: A literature review, European Journal of Operational Research, 217, 1, pp. 1-16, (2012); Beliën, Jeroen, Optimizing the facility location design of organ transplant centers, Decision Support Systems, 54, 4, pp. 1568-1579, (2013); Bi, Xiaojun, An improved NSGA-III algorithm based on objective space decomposition for many-objective optimization, Soft Computing, 21, 15, pp. 4269-4296, (2017); Ieeexplore Ieee Org, (2013); Dillon, Mary, A two-stage stochastic programming model for inventory management in the blood supply chain, International Journal of Production Economics, 187, pp. 27-41, (2017); Duan, Qinglin, Optimization of blood supply chain with shortened shelf lives and ABO compatibility, International Journal of Production Economics, 153, pp. 113-129, (2014); Fahimnia, Behnam, Supply chain design for efficient and effective blood supply in disasters, International Journal of Production Economics, 183, pp. 700-709, (2017); Fazli-Khalaf, Mohamadreza, Mixed robust possibilistic flexible chance constraint optimization model for emergency blood supply chain network design, Annals of Operations Research, 283, 1-2, pp. 1079-1109, (2019); Strategic Supply Chain Alignment Best Practice in Supply Chain Management, (1998)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14327643; 14337479","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113851875"

Storage location assignment and crane scheduling are both important problems in slab yards, which connect the continuous casting area and the hot rolling area and play a vital buffer role in maintaining the balance of the hot rolling production process. This paper presents a mixed integrated programming (MIP) model with two objectives – relocation rate and feed length, which indicate the performance of storage location assignment and crane scheduling in an unmanned slab yard, respectively. To solve this multi-objective optimization problem with large-scale parameters and complicated constraints, this paper proposes to modify the standard NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) by employing dispatching rules-based initial population generation, adaptive crossover and mutation operations, and improved reference point generation. A case study with actual inventory and production data shows that the proposed algorithm reduces the relocation rate from 30% to 10%. The well-known MOEA/D (Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition) is applied to compare the performance of the modified NSGA-III. The quality of the Pareto front and the objective values indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the integrated optimization of storage location assignment and crane scheduling and performs better than MOEA/D. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crane scheduling; Modified NSGA-III; Multi-objective optimization; Storage location assignment; Unmanned slab yard","Buffer storage; Continuous casting; Cranes; Hot rolled steel; Hot rolling; Location; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling; Crane scheduling; Integrated optimization; Modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimisation of storages; Performance; Slab yard; Storage location assignments; Unmanned slab yard; Genetic algorithms","","","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the grant number 61903031 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under the grant number FRF-TP-18-035A1 and FRF-TP-20-050A2.","Abdelhafez, Amr, Performance analysis of synchronous and asynchronous distributed genetic algorithms on multiprocessors, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 49, pp. 147-157, (2019); Abou Kasm, Omar, The quay crane scheduling problem with non-crossing and safety clearance constraints: An exact solution approach, Computers and Operations Research, 107, pp. 189-199, (2019); Ballestín, Francisco, A multistage heuristic for storage and retrieval problems in a warehouse with random storage, International Transactions in Operational Research, 27, 3, pp. 1699-1728, (2020); Bi, Xiaojun, An improved NSGA-III algorithm based on elimination operator for many-objective optimization, Memetic Computing, 9, 4, pp. 361-383, (2017); Branca, Teresa Annunziata, The challenge of digitalization in the steel sector, Metals, 10, 2, (2020); Celik, Melih, Order picking under random and turnover-based storage policies in fishbone aisle warehouses, IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers), 46, 3, pp. 283-300, (2014); Chen, Xiaohui, An approximate nondominated sorting genetic algorithm to integrate optimization of production scheduling and accurate maintenance based on reliability intervals, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 54, pp. 227-241, (2020); Chu, Feng, Scheduling multiple yard cranes in two adjacent container blocks with position-dependent processing times, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 136, pp. 355-365, (2019); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113319826"

Therefore, social manufacturing (Social Mfg) system came into being. Under the Social Mfg environment, a flexible configuration method of distributed MRs is put forward in this paper, which is qualified to quickly respond to order demand and production disturbance. Firstly, superior manufacturing services are selected from the resource pool of the platform according to the types of subtasks. Secondly, high-quality service compositions capable of completing a complicated manufacturing task are obtained by NSGA-III algorithm, which meets the requirements of multi-objective optimization in terms of time, cost and quality. In addition, a MRs collaborative network model is constructed based on the historical cooperation data. The Louvain algorithm is employed to detect the manufacturing communities (MCs) from the collaborative network. Finally, the MCs are applied to provide the optimal service schemes for personalized demand at a fast speed, as well as realizing dynamic reconfiguration of MRs under abnormal disturbance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses significant performance in both efficiency and robustness, and makes great contributions to the development of Social Mfg in terms of resource configuration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative production; Manufacturing community; Production disturbance; Production networks; Social manufacturing","Data acquisition; Dynamic models; Multiobjective optimization; Service industry; Collaborative network; Distributed manufacturing; Dynamic re-configuration; High quality service; Manufacturing resource; Manufacturing service; Real time data acquisition; Resource configurations; Manufacture","","","This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2020YFB1710500 ], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 52075257 , 51805253 ] and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number NP2020304 ].","Andreadis, Georgios, A collaborative framework for social media aware manufacturing, Manufacturing Letters, 3, pp. 14-17, (2015); Blondel, Vincent, Fast unfolding of communities in large networks, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008, 10, (2008); Chen, Baotong, Edge Computing in IoT-Based Manufacturing, IEEE Communications Magazine, 56, 9, pp. 103-109, (2018); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016); Cheng, Ying, Modeling of manufacturing service supply–demand matching hypernetwork in service-oriented manufacturing systems, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 45, pp. 59-72, (2017); Cheng, Jiangfeng, Industrial IoT in 5G environment towards smart manufacturing, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 10, pp. 10-19, (2018); Dao, Son Duy, An innovative model for resource scheduling in VCIM systems, Operational Research, 18, 1, pp. 33-54, (2018); Dao, Son Duy, An innovative GA for optimisation of integrated manufacturing–transportation scheduling in VCIM systems, Operational Research, 20, 3, pp. 1289-1320, (2020); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01663615","","CINUD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109495798"

Approaching the optimal design of a rockfill dam paves the path to achieve the best quality with the fewest expenses. Choosing the Sardasht rockfill dam as a case study, two semi-empirical models are presented for seepage and safety factor. These two models, together with construction costs, were employed as three objective functions for the Sardasht rockfill dam's shape optimization. Optimization was handled using a robust multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (RCR-MOPSO). A new reproducing method inspired by a Rubik's cube shape (RCR) and NSGA-III are building blocks of RCR-MOPSO. Three benchmark problems and two real-world problems were solved using RCR-MOPSO and compared with NSGA-III and MOPSO to ensure the performance of RCR-MOPSO. The solution quality and performance of RCR-MOPSO are significantly better than the original MOPSO and close to NSGA-III. Nevertheless, RCR-MOPSO recorded a 38% shorter runtime than NSGA-III. RCR-MOPSO presented a set of non-dominated solutions as final results for the Sardasht rockfill dam shape optimization. Due to the defined constraints, all solutions dominate the original design. Regarding the final results, compared with Sardasht dam's original design, the construction price was reduced by 31.12% on average, while seepage and safety factor improved by 15.84% and 27.78% on average, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Design methods & aids; Earth dams; Safety & hazards","","","","","Chopard, Bastien, Particle swarm optimization, Natural Computing Series, pp. 97-102, (2018); Safari, Sadegh, Multi-objective optimization of solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine combined heat and power system: A comparison between particle swarm and genetic algorithms, International Journal of Energy Research, 44, 11, pp. 9001-9020, (2020); Mahmoud, Ali, Investigation on labyrinth spillway multi-objective optimization with an emphasis on predicting discharge coefficient through different artificial neural networks, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 174, (2021); Mahmoud, Ali, An Improved Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization with TOPSIS and Fuzzy Logic for Optimizing Trapezoidal Labyrinth Weir, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 25458-25472, (2021); Chen, Chen, An Improved NSGA-III Algorithm for Reservoir Flood Control Operation, Water Resources Management, 31, 14, pp. 4469-4483, (2017); Ji, Bin, Modified NSGA-II for Solving Continuous Berth Allocation Problem: Using Multiobjective Constraint-Handling Strategy, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 47, 9, pp. 2885-2895, (2017); Curtis, Mathew, Reduction of computational load for MOPSO, Procedia Computer Science, 51, 1, pp. 2789-2793, (2015); Pan, Anqi, A diversity enhanced multiobjective particle swarm optimization, Information Sciences, 436-437, pp. 441-465, (2018); Xu, Y.

Traditional measures such as education and legislation have contributed to limited improvements in terms of reducing accidents due to people driving in undesirable statuses, such as when suffering from stress or drowsiness. Attention is drawn to predicting drivers’ future status so that precautions can be taken in advance as effective preventative measures. Common prediction algorithms include recurrent neural networks (RNNs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. To benefit from the advantages of each algorithm, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) can be applied to merge the three algorithms. This is named NSGAIII- optimized RNN-GRU-LSTM. An analysis can be made to compare the proposed prediction algorithm with the individual RNN, GRU, and LSTM algorithms. Our proposed model improves the overall accuracy by 11.2–13.6% and 10.2–12.2% in driver stress prediction and driver drowsiness prediction, respectively. Likewise, it improves the overall accuracy by 6.9–12.7% and 6.9–8.9%, respectively, compared with boosting learning with multiple RNNs, multiple GRUs, and multiple LSTMs algorithms. Compared with existing works, this proposal offers to enhance performance by taking some key factors into account—namely, using a real-world driving dataset, a greater sample size, hybrid algorithms, and cross-validation. Future research directions have been suggested for further exploration and performance enhancement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","At-risk driving; Driver drowsiness; Driver stress; Gated recurrent unit; Intelligent transportation; Long short-term memory network; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Recurrent neural network","Accidents; Brain; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; At-risk driving; Driver drowsiness; Driver stress; Gated recurrent unit; Intelligent transportation; Long short-term memory network; Memory network; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III; Long short-term memory; algorithm; attention; forecasting; human; long term memory; Algorithms; Attention; Humans; Memory, Long-Term; Neural Networks, Computer","","","Funding: The work described in this paper was fully supported by the Hong Kong Metropolitan University Research Grant (No. 2019/1.7).","Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2018, (2018); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2025); Rolison, Jonathan James, What are the factors that contribute to road accidents?

However, the performance of LSSCP becomes inefficient due to harsh operating conditions resulting in substantial increase in energy consumption. Many-objective optimization is significant in improving the performance of LSSCP and promoting the sustainability of district energy systems. Among the existing optimization methods, global optimization methods are limited by high computational cost when solving many-objective optimization problems, and gradient-based optimization methods face difficulties in locating the global optimum. In the present study, a hybrid optimization method was developed for solving many-objective optimization problems of LSSCP. The LSSCP optimization result of the hybrid algorithm was compared with that of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA), so as to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed method. In the designed flow condition without cavitation, the hydraulic efficiency obtained by the hybrid optimization algorithm was found to be 9.5%, 5.4%, and 4.7% higher than those of the original, NSGA-II, and NSGA-III optimized results, respectively. The shaft power was 10.3%, 8.7% and 5.1% less than said three optimized results. The maximum turbulent kinetic energy in the flow passage obtained from the hybrid optimization was only 2.2 J/kg, which was 67% and 46% less than that of the NSGA-II and NSGA-III optimized results, respectively. In the designed flow condition with cavitation, the net positive suction head critical optimized by the hybrid model was 0.857 m, which was substantially reduced compared with the original and NSGA-II optimized results. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Centrifugal pump; Many-objective optimization; Neural network; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III","design; genetic algorithm; hybrid; optimization; pump; sustainability","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52075481, 52075477) and the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (LR19E050002).","Paredes-Sánchez, Beatriz María, Analysis of district heating and cooling energy systems in Spain: Resources, technology and management, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 10, (2021); Sarbu, Ioan, Energy savings potential for pumping water in district heating stations, Sustainability (Switzerland), 7, 5, pp. 5705-5719, (2015); Pei, Ji, Optimization on the impeller of a low-specific-speed centrifugal pump for hydraulic performance improvement, Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering (English Edition), 29, 5, pp. 992-1002, (2016); Zhang, Renhui, Knowledge Mining of Low Specific Speed Centrifugal Pump Impeller Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Method, Journal of Thermal Science, 30, 3, pp. 840-848, (2021); An, Zhao, Multi-objective optimization of a low specific speed centrifugal pump using an evolutionary algorithm, Engineering Optimization, 48, 7, pp. 1251-1274, (2016); Kaya, Durmuş, Energy efficiency in pumps, Energy Conversion and Management, 49, 6, pp. 1662-1673, (2008); Derakhshan, Shahram, Numerical shape optimization of a centrifugal pump impeller using artificial bee colony algorithm, Computers and Fluids, 81, pp. 145-151, (2013); Wang, Wenjie, Multi-condition optimization of cavitation performance on a double-suction centrifugal pump based on ANN and NSGA-II, Processes, 8, 9, (2020); Safikhani, Hamed, Pareto based multi-objective optimization of centrifugal pumps using CFD, neural networks and genetic algorithms, Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics, 5, 1, pp. 37-48, (2011); Yang, Wei, Multiobjective optimization design of a pump-turbine impeller based on an inverse design using a combination optimization strategy, Journal of Fluids Engineering, 136, 1, (2014)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115798674"

A newly introduced computing paradigm with a distributed feature, i.e., edge computing, can be a complement to the centralized cloud computing with computation offloaded to the distributed edge servers (ESs). Typically, edge servers are the host of IoV services in edge computing, which requires an appropriate quantification and placement before the implementation of computation offloading. To pursue a higher quality of service (QoS), the quantity and locations of the ESs need to be thoroughly discussed ahead. Otherwise, additional delay and network congestion will occur. Simultaneously, as the ITS is continuously developing, the existing placement of ESs ought to be adjusted to be in line with the dynamic change of IoV traffic. However, ES placement schemes are often devised by clustering methods with a fixed ES quantity and are unaware of the extensibility of the placement. To address the problems that mentioned, a dynamic ES placement approach (DEP) is developed. Technically, DEP leverages the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) for placements with better performance and less reconstruction of existing placement. The population of NSGA-III is initialized with clustering algorithms for a higher accuracy and convergence speed, and the fitness of minimum reconstruction cost is calculated based on Kuhn–Munkres bipartite graph matching algorithm. A real-world traffic data with 436 deployed roadside units in the provincial capital city Nanjing, China, is leveraged for comparative experiments. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of DEP with a 17.64% lower latency and 25.82% lower workload standard deviation comparing to the clustering method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bipartite graph matching; Edge server placement; Evolutionary multi-objective optimization; Internet of Vehicles","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Edge computing; Genetic algorithms; Graph theory; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Quality of service; Vehicles; Bipartite graph matching; Cloud-computing; Edge server; Edge server placement; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of vehicle; Server placements; Vehicle service; Multiobjective optimization","","","This research is supported by the NUIST, China Students’ Platform for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program under grant no. 202010300024Z , and the Financial and Science Technology Plan Project of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, China under grant no. 2020DB005 .","Gunasekaran, Raja P., AI-Powered blockchain - A decentralized secure multiparty computation protocol for IoV, pp. 865-870, (2020); Abbas, Asad, An opportunistic data dissemination for autonomous vehicles communication, Soft Computing, 25, 18, pp. 11899-11912, (2021); IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, (2020); Cheng, Chien-Fu Fu, Fault-Tolerance Mechanisms for Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 22, 6, pp. 3859-3868, (2021); Khan, Fazlullah, A Secured and Reliable Continuous Transmission Scheme in Cognitive HARQ-Aided Internet of Things, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 19, pp. 14835-14844, (2021); Liu, Shaoshan, Edge Computing for Autonomous Driving: Opportunities and Challenges, Proceedings of the IEEE, 107, 8, pp. 1697-1716, (2019); Ali, Amjad, Priority-based cloud computing architecture for multimedia-enabled heterogeneous vehicular users, Journal of Advanced Transportation, 2018, (2018); Jhaveri, Rutvij H., Managing industrial communication delays with software-defined networking, (2019); Xue, Xiao, Value Entropy: A Systematic Evaluation Model of Service Ecosystem Evolution, IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, 15, 4, pp. 1760-1773, (2022); Bozorgchenani, Arash, Centralized and Distributed Architectures for Energy and Delay Efficient Fog Network-Based Edge Computing Services, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 3, 1, pp. 250-263, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01403664; 1873703X","","COCOD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111503082"

However, most existing studies for CMaOPs can be classified as feasibility-driven-constrained many-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMaOEAs), and they always give priority to satisfy constraints, while ignoring the maintenance of the population diversity for dealing with conflicting objectives. Consequently, the population may be pushed toward some locally feasible optimal or locally infeasible areas in the high-dimensional objective space. To alleviate this issue, this article presents a problem transformation technique, which transforms a CMaOP into a dynamic CMaOP (DCMaOP) for handling constraints and optimizing objectives simultaneously, to help the population cross the large and discrete infeasible regions. The well-known reference-point-based NSGA-III is tailored under the problem transformation model to solve CMaOPs, namely, DCNSGA-III. In this article, $\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }$ -feasible solutions play an important role in the proposed algorithm. To this end, in DCNSGA-III, a mating selection mechanism and an environmental selection operator are designed to generate and choose high-quality $\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }$ -feasible offspring solutions, respectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a series of benchmark CMaOPs with three, five, eight, ten, and 15 objectives and compared against six state-of-the-art CMaOEAs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive for solving CMaOPs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained optimization; evolutionary computation; many-objective optimization; problem transformation","Constraint satisfaction problems; Evolutionary algorithms; Conflicting objectives; Constraints satisfaction; Handling constraints; Many-objective optimizations; Population diversity; Problem transformations; Selection mechanism; Selection operators; Constrained optimization; article; controlled study; evolutionary algorithm; feasibility study; human; mating; progeny; satisfaction","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62076226, Grant 61673355, and Grant 61673331; in part by the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 2015CFA010; in part by the 111 Project under Grant B17040; and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) under Grant CUGGC02.","Cai, Xinye, A Grid Weighted Sum Pareto Local Search for Combinatorial Multi and Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 9, pp. 3586-3598, (2019); Elarbi, Maha, A New Decomposition-Based NSGA-II for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 48, 7, pp. 1191-1210, (2018); Wang, Jiahai, A Two-Stage Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm for Multiobjective Multidepot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 7, pp. 2467-2478, (2019); Zhang, Yuhui, DECAL: Decomposition-based coevolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 1, pp. 27-41, (2019); Xu, Qinghui, On Formulating and Designing Antenna Arrays by Evolutionary Algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 69, 2, pp. 1118-1129, (2021); Li, Bingdong, Many-objective evolutionary algorithms: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 48, 1, (2015); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 779, pp. 85-118, (2019); Li, Ke, Two-Archive Evolutionary Algorithm for Constrained Multiobjective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 23, 2, pp. 303-315, (2019); Wang, Jiahai, Cooperative Differential Evolution Framework for Constrained Multiobjective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 49, 6, pp. 2060-2072, (2019); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21682267; 21682275","","","33206620","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096881455"

However, it is troublesome to guarantee the overall operating performance of ENs due to the uneven distributed resource demands of UEs, the resulting transmission delay and the data loss for computation offloading between the covered EN and the deployed destination EN. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-based computation offloading method, named BCO, is proposed in this paper. Technically, since blockchain is a promising technique for the decentralized system, a blockchain-based EC framework is designed to degrade the data loss possibility by integrating blockchain and EC. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, the third version (NSGA-III), is leveraged to acquire the balanced offloading strategies. Furthermore, by taking advantage of Simple Additive Weighting and Multiple Criteria Decision Making, the optimal offloading strategy is identified. Finally, systematic experiments and analyses on the comparative experiment are conducted to verify the efficiency of our proposed method BCO. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","5G; blockchain; computation offloading; edge computing","5G mobile communication systems; computation offloading; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Queueing networks; 5g; Block-chain; Computation offloading; Computing paradigm; Computing-task; Data loss; Edge computing; Operating performance; Resource limitations; User equipments; Blockchain","","","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 61702277 and 61872219).

In the last few years, there have been many proposals to use decomposition to solve unconstrained problems. However, fewer is the amount of works that has been devoted to propose new decomposition-based algorithms to solve constrained many-objective problems. In this paper, we propose the ISC-Pareto dominance (Isolated Solution-based Constrained Pareto dominance) relation that has the ability to: (1) handle constrained many-objective problems characterized by different types of difficulties and (2) favor the selection of not only infeasible solutions associated to isolated sub-regions but also infeasible solutions with smaller CV (Constraint Violation) values. Our constraint handling strategy has been integrated into the framework of the Constrained Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (C-NSGA-III) to produce a new algorithm called Isolated Solution-based Constrained NSGA-III (ISC-NSGA-III). The empirical results have demonstrated that our constraint handling strategy is able to provide better and competitive results when compared against three recently proposed constrained decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms in addition to a penalty-based version of NSGA-III on the CDTLZ benchmark problems involving up to fifteen objectives. Moreover, the efficacy of ISC-NSGA-III on a real world water management problem is showcased. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained optimization; Decomposition; Evolutionary algorithms; Many-objective optimization","Decomposition; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Water management; Constraint handling strategies; Constraint violation; Infeasible solutions; Management problems; Many-objective optimizations; Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs); Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Unconstrained problems; Constrained optimization","","","","Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007); Elarbi, Maha, Multi-objective optimization: Classical and evolutionary approaches, Adaptation, Learning, and Optimization, 20, pp. 1-30, (2017); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, (2001); Zitzler, Eckart, Indicator-based selection in multiobjective search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3242, pp. 832-842, (2004); Sülflow, André, Robust multi-objective optimization in high dimensional spaces, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4403 LNCS, pp. 715-726, (2007); Kasprzyk, Joseph R., Managing population and drought risks using many-objective water portfolio planning under uncertainty, Water Resources Research, 45, 12, (2009); López-Jaimes, Antonio, Some techniques to deal with many-objective problems, 2009-January, pp. 2693-2696, (2009); Ishibuchi, Hisao, Performance of Decomposition-Based Many-Objective Algorithms Strongly Depends on Pareto Front Shapes, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 21, 2, pp. 169-190, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055560244"

In particular, tractors generate considerable transmission gear whine noises during operation, and such noises need to be reduced for the driver's comfort. The gear whine noise level is related to peak-to-peak static transmission errors (PPSTEs), and the PPSTE can be minimized through the gear macro-geometry optimization method. Here, we optimized the gear macro-geometry of a 75-kW agricultural tractor transmission through a genetic algorithm (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; NSGA-III) to minimize PPSTEs. The two gear pairs were optimized to maintain the gear mesh efficiency at similar levels and to minimize the PPSTE to less than 25 % of the existing gear specifications. To determine the improvement in noise, the noise levels were evaluated and compared using a 3-axis dynamometer tester. The overall noise level in the transmission operating range was found to reduce by 3.1 dBA, and all the noise levels of the gear harmonic components were reduced effectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural tractor; Gear macro-geometry; Gear whine noise; Optimization; Transmission; Transmission error","Agriculture; Genetic algorithms; Hydraulic equipment; Tractors (agricultural); Gear macro-geometry; Gear whine noise; Gear whines; Noise levels; Noise source; Optimisations; Peak-to-peak; Static transmission errors; Tractor transmission; Transmission error; Geometry; genetic algorithm; geometry; noise; optimization","","","","Bonori, Giorgio, Optimum profile modifications of spur gears by means of genetic algorithms, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 313, 3-5, pp. 603-616, (2008); Campos Ciro, Guillermo, A NSGA-II and NSGA-III comparison for solving an open shop scheduling problem with resource constraints, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, 12, pp. 1272-1277, (2016); Colabawala, Muquarram, An experimental procedure for characterization of gear whine noise in a variety of vehicle applications, SAE Technical Papers, (2003); Fonseca, Daniel J., A genetic algorithm approach to minimize transmission error of automotive spur gear sets, Applied Artificial Intelligence, 19, 2, pp. 153-179, (2005); Ghosh, Sayan S., On optimal tooth profile modification for reduction of vibration and noise in spur gear pairs, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 105, pp. 145-163, (2016); Gonzalez-de-Soto, Mariano, Reducing fuel consumption in weed and pest control using robotic tractors, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 114, pp. 96-113, (2015); Guo, Rong, Experimental investigation of the noise, vibration and harshness performances of a range-extended electric vehicle, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 230, 5, pp. 650-663, (2016); Göloǧlu, Cevdet, A genetic approach to automate preliminary design of gear drives, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 57, 3, pp. 1043-1051, (2009); Houser, Donald R., Gear Noise and Vibration Prediction and Control Methods, pp. 847-856, (2008); undefined, (1995)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111575240"

To achieve this, the compressive sensing and five-dimensional hyper-chaotic map (FDHC) are utilized to encrypt the biomedical images. However, FDHC suffers from the hyper-parameter tuning problem. To resolve this, a θ -non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III ( θ -NSGA-III) based FDHC is proposed. Initially, the initial attributes of FDHC are tuned using θ -NSGA-III. Then, the tuned attributes are used by FDHC to generate the secret keys. The obtained secret keys are then utilized to permute and diffuse the input biomedical images. Permutation and diffusion operations are applied row-wise and column-wise on the input biomedical image to perform encryption. The proposed technique is sensitive towards the input images as the permutation and diffusion of each row and column depends upon the initial scrambled row and column. Experimental results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-art image encryption techniques. The proposed framework encrypts and decrypts images at a higher speed, therefore, it can be used to secure the communication in green IoT networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hyper-chaotic maps; Image encryption; parameter tuning; θ-NSGA-III","Chaotic systems; Cryptography; eHealth; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Biomedical images; Compressive sensing; E-health care; Energy efficient; Green internets; Hyper-parameter; Internet of Things (IOT); Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Network security","","","","Huang, Huawei, Green Data-Collection from Geo-Distributed IoT Networks through Low-Earth-Orbit Satellites, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 3, 3, pp. 806-816, (2019); Liao, Haijun, Learning-Based Context-Aware Resource Allocation for Edge-Computing-Empowered Industrial IoT, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 5, pp. 4260-4277, (2020); Tewari, Aakanksha, Security, privacy and trust of different layers in Internet-of-Things (IoTs) framework, Future Generation Computer Systems, 108, pp. 909-920, (2020); Esposito, Christian Carmine, Blockchain-based authentication and authorization for smart city applications, Information Processing and Management, 58, 2, (2021); Stergiou, Christos L., Iot-based big data secure management in the fog over a 6G wireless network, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 7, pp. 5164-5171, (2021); Adat Vasudevan, Vipindev, Security in Internet of Things: issues, challenges, taxonomy, and architecture, Telecommunication Systems, 67, 3, pp. 423-441, (2018); He, Xiaoming, Green Resource Allocation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Content-Centric IoT, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 8, 3, pp. 781-796, (2020); Saba, Tanzila, Secure and energy-efficient framework using Internet of Medical Things for e-healthcare, Journal of Infection and Public Health, 13, 10, pp. 1567-1575, (2020); Yan, Xuehu, Visual secret sharing based on random grids with abilities of AND and XOR lossless recovery, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 74, 9, pp. 3231-3252, (2015); Azari, Amin, On the Latency-Energy Performance of NB-IoT Systems in Providing Wide-Area IoT Connectivity, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 4, 1, pp. 57-68, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","24732400","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107198063"

Unfortunately, the imbalanced class distribution and the complex intrinsic structure in software projects make it challenging to obtain suitable defect features and construct a predominant CVDP model. To address these challenges, we propose a robust hybrid CVDP model named WGNCS based on WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty), multi-objective NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm - III) algorithm and hybrid CNN-SVM (Convolutional Neural Network – Support Vector Machine) in this study, which has three main merits: (1) employ a powerful deep learning generative model – WGAN-GP to conduct data augmentation tasks, thereby achieving defect class balance and generating more training instances. (2) utilize the multi-objective NSGA-III algorithm to select the fewest representative training feature subset for the minimum error. (3) construct a single powerful defect predictor CNN-SVM by cascading a high-level deep semantic feature extractor (CNN) and a classifier (SVM) with the fixed non-linear Gaussian kernel function. We verify the CVDP performance of WGNCS on 32 cross-version pairs derived from 45 software project versions. The experimental results demonstrate that the WGNCS model can exhibit encouraging performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional neural network; Cross-version defect prediction; Deep learning techniques; Multi-objective feature selection; Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty","Convolution; Deep learning; Defects; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Semantics; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Cross-version defect prediction; Deep learning technique; Defect prediction; Defect prediction models; Multi objective; Multi-objective feature selection; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Software program; Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty; Feature extraction","","","The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments, which greatly improved the quality of this paper.

However, it cannot be applied to ranking problems involving many alternatives, because the number of pairwise comparisons can then be rather large. In this paper, we present an evolution-based approach for exploiting large fuzzy outranking relations and deriving a crisp outranking relation with desirable properties. Therefore, the utilization of a fuzzy outranking relation is modeled as a three-objective optimization problem, which is solved by an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed ranking algorithm is a hybrid of the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and a reference point method with the repeated use of a choice mechanism. In addition, a method that portrays the obtained ranking in a Hasse diagram is used for recommendation purposes. We designate the new method RP2-NSGA-II+H. In our experiments, the proposed ranking procedure demonstrates a better performance in terms of ranking error rates than other ranking procedures based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Our experimental results also demonstrate that, with the new procedure, this method can be scaled for hundreds of alternatives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ELECTRE III; Fuzzy outranking relations; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiple criteria analysis; Ranking procedures","Decision support systems; Elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Evolution-based approach; Genetic-based algorithms; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding; Non-dominated Sorting; Objective optimization; Reference point method; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was partially supported by the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT) of Mexico [grant number #252663]; the hSNS FCT of Portugal [grant number PTDCEGE-OGE305462017]; and the FCT of Portugal [grant number SFRHBSAB1398922018].","Aiello, Giuseppe, A non dominated ranking Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm and electre method for unequal area facility layout problems, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 12, pp. 4812-4819, (2013); Bouyssou, Denis, Ranking methods based on valued preference relations: A characterization of the net flow method, European Journal of Operational Research, 60, 1, pp. 61-67, (1992); Evaluation and Decision Models A Critical Perspective, (2000); Management Science, (2025); Calders, Toon, PROMETHEE is not quadratic: An O(qnlog(n)) algorithm, Omega (United Kingdom), 76, pp. 63-69, (2018); Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Engineering, (2013); de Smet, Yves, Multicriteria relational clustering: The case of binary outranking matrices, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5467 LNCS, pp. 380-392, (2010); de Smet, Yves, Towards multicriteria clustering: An extension of the k-means algorithm, European Journal of Operational Research, 158, 2, pp. 390-398, (2004); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research, (2006)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03772217","","EJORD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099134432"

But MANET nodes are prone to various security threats. To overcome this issue, many trust management frameworks have been implemented in the literature. It has been found that the use of machine learning can predict trust values more efficiently. However, machine learning performance suffers from the hyper-parameters tuning and over-fitting issues. Therefore, in this paper, novel trust management is proposed. initially, the Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to train the trust prediction model. Thereafter, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is used to tune the hyper-parameters of the ANFIS model. Precision, recall, and root mean squared error metrics are used to design a multi-objective fitness function. Optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol is used for comparative analyses purpose. Three different attacks are applied on the designed network i.e., link spoofing, jellyfish, and gray hole attacks to obtain the dataset. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed trust evaluation model outperforms the competitive trust evaluation models in terms of various performance metrics such as routing overheads, average end to end latency, packet delivery ratio, and throughput. Thus, the proposed protocol is more secure against various security threats. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attacks; MANET; Routing; Trust evaluation","Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Predictive analytics; Security systems; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Multi-objective fitness function; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimized Link State Routing; Packet delivery ratio; Root mean squared errors; Trust management frameworks; Fuzzy inference","","","","Bhuvaneswari, R., Denial of service attack solution in OLSR based manet by varying number of fictitious nodes, Cluster Computing, 22, pp. 12689-12699, (2019); Vanitha, K., Preventing malicious packet dropping nodes in MANET using IFHM based SAODV routing protocol, Cluster Computing, 22, pp. 13453-13461, (2019); Serhani, Abdellatif, AQ-Routing: mobility-, stability-aware adaptive routing protocol for data routing in MANET–IoT systems, Cluster Computing, 23, 1, pp. 13-27, (2020); Manikandan, J., Fuzzy hierarchical ant colony optimization routing for weighted cluster in MANET, Cluster Computing, 22, pp. 9637-9649, (2019); Sangeetha, S.

Given the fluctuating unit load and complex desulfurization mechanism, optimizing the desulfurization system based on the traditional mechanistic model poses a great challenge. In this regard, the present study optimized the eco-efficiency from the perspective of operating data analysis. We formulated the issue of eco-efficiency improvement into a many-objective optimization problem. Considering the complexity between the system inputs and outputs and to further reduce the computational cost, we constructed a Kriging model and made a comparison between this model and the response surface methodology based on two accuracy metrics. This surrogate model was then incorporated into the NSGA-III algorithm to obtain the Pareto-optimal front. As this Pareto-optimal front provides multiple alternative operating options, we applied the TOPSIS to select the most appropriate alternative set of operating parameters. This approach was validated using the historical operation data from the desulfurization system at a coal-fired power plant in China with a 600 MW unit. The results indicated that the optimization would cause an improvement in the efficiency of desulfurization and energy efficiency but a slight increase in the consumption of limestone slurry. This study attempted to provide an effective operating strategy to enhance the eco-efficiency performance of desulfurization systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data-driven modeling; Eco-efficiency; Kriging model; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III","algorithm; coal-fired power plant; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; limestone; optimization; performance assessment; China","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors appreciate the support from Datang environmental industry group Co., Ltd.

This paper aims to solve an environmental-oriented multi-objective reconfigurable manufacturing system design (i.e., sustainable reconfigurable machines and tools selection) in the case of a single-unit process plan generation. A non-linear multi-objective integer program (NL-MOIP) is presented first, where four objectives are minimized respectively, the total production cost, the total production time, the amount of the greenhouse gases emitted by machines, and the hazardous liquid wastes. Second, to solve the problem, we propose four adapted versions of evolutionary approaches, namely two versions of the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II and NSGA-III), weighted genetic algorithms (WGA), and random weighted genetic algorithms (RWGA). To show the efficiency of the four approaches, several instances of the problem are experimented, and the obtained results are analyzed using three metrics respectively hypervolume, spacing metric, and cardinality of the mixed Pareto fronts.

In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for simultaneous optimization of an open channel section and a labyrinth weir geometry. A recently proposed optimizer called Multi-Objective Multi-Verse Optimization (MOMVO) algorithm is employed and its results are compared with Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) using five metrics, including spacing (SP), Maximum Spread (MS), Non-uniformity of Pareto Front (NPF), Mean Ideal Distance (MID), and Coverage Measure (CM). The first objective function is defined to minimize the construction costs per unit length of the open channel, and the second one is to minimize total concrete volume of the labyrinth weir. The results showed significant differences between MOMVO Pareto optimal solutions and the other two algorithms. The least values of SP, NPF, and MID metrics were provided by MOMVO, which meant its solutions had better conditions regarding uniformity and the closeness to the ideal point. To optimize irrigation network as a system, penalty functions were applied to satisfy hydraulic conditions (flow velocity, Froude number, and nappe interference). Results showed that if the proposed model had been employed in Isfahan Irrigation Networks (IINs) design, it would have reduced the construction costs of open channel and labyrinth weir approximately 11% and 74%, respectively. It can be reported that the most cost-effective design has the least channel wetted perimeter, channel cross-section top width, cross-sectional area, and labyrinth apex length; and the highest channel depth, and weir sidewall angles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithm; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithm; Labyrinth weirs; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-Verse optimizer; NSGA-III; Open channels; Optimal hydraulic structures; Optimization","Cost effectiveness; Flow velocity; Genetic algorithms; Irrigation; Open channel flow; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Weirs; Channel cross section; Cost effective design; Cross sectional area; Hydraulic conditions; Multi-objective optimization problem; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Pareto optimal solutions; Simultaneous optimization; Multiobjective optimization","","","The authors would like to thank the Zayandab Consulting Engineers Company for providing the necessary information.","Agu, Cornelius Emeka, Algorithm with improved accuracy for real-time measurement of flow rate in open channel systems, Flow Measurement and Instrumentation, 57, pp. 20-27, (2017); Vatankhah, Ali R., Normal depth and wetted perimeter in general power-law channels, Flow Measurement and Instrumentation, 64, pp. 234-241, (2018); Dai, Shubing, Explicit formulas of normal, alternate and conjugate depths for three kinds of parabola-shaped channels, Flow Measurement and Instrumentation, 74, (2020); Li, Xin, Influence of the structure of cylindrical mobile flumes on hydraulic performance characteristics in U-shaped channels, Flow Measurement and Instrumentation, 72, (2020); Khosravinia, Payam, Application of novel data mining algorithms in prediction of discharge and end depth in trapezoidal sections, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 170, (2020); Monadjemi, Parviz, General formulation of best hydraulic channel section, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering - ASCE, 120, 1, pp. 27-35, (1994); Jain, Ashu, Optimal design of composite channels using genetic algorithm, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering - ASCE, 130, 4, pp. 286-295, (2004); Nourani, Vahid, Application of ant colony optimization to optimal design of open channels, Journal of Hydraulic Research/De Recherches Hydrauliques, 47, 5, pp. 656-665, (2009); Manne, Janga Reddy, Overtopping probability constrained optimal design of composite channels using swarm intelligence technique, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering - ASCE, 136, 8, pp. 532-542, (2010); Sankaran Namboothiri, Adarsh A., Gravitational search algorithm for probabilistic design of HBPS canals, ISH Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 21, 3, pp. 290-297, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09555986","","FMEIE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107390285"

But due to the physical limitations in the number of qubits of a single quantum device, the computation should be performed in a distributed system. In this paper, a new model of quantum computation based on the matrix representation of quantum circuits is proposed. Then, using this model, we propose a novel approach for reducing the number of teleportations in a distributed quantum circuit. The proposed method consists of two phases: the pre-processing phase and the optimization phase. In the pre-processing phase, it considers the bi-partitioning of quantum circuits by Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) to minimize the number of global gates and to distribute the quantum circuit into two balanced parts with equal number of qubits and minimum number of global gates. In the optimization phase, two heuristics named Heuristic I and Heuristic II are proposed to optimize the number of teleportations according to the partitioning obtained from the pre-processing phase. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on many benchmark quantum circuits. The results of these evaluations show an average of 22.16% improvement in the teleportation cost of the proposed approach compared to the existing works in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distributed quantum circuit; NSGA-III; Quantum circuit; Teleportation cost","Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Genetic algorithms; Qubits; Timing circuits; Connectivity matrix; Distributed systems; ITS applications; Matrix representation; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Physical limitations; Quantum circuit; Single quantum; Matrix algebra","","","","Grover, Lov K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Part F129452, pp. 212-219, (1996); undefined, (1997); Shor, Peter W., Polynomial-time algorithms for prime factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantum computer, SIAM Review, 41, 2, pp. 303-332, (1999); Huang, Heliang, Experimental Blind Quantum Computing for a Classical Client, Physical Review Letters, 119, 5, (2017); Krantz, Philip, A quantum engineer's guide to superconducting qubits, Applied Physics Reviews, 6, 2, (2019); Cacciapuoti, Angela Sara, When Entanglement Meets Classical Communications: Quantum Teleportation for the Quantum Internet, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 68, 6, pp. 3808-3833, (2020); Cacciapuoti, Angela Sara, Toward the Quantum Internet: A Directional-dependent Noise Model for Quantum Signal Processing, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2019-May, pp. 7978-7982, (2019); Quantum Simulations with Trapped Ions, (2012); Bruzewicz, Colin D., Trapped-ion quantum computing: Progress and challenges, Applied Physics Reviews, 6, 2, (2019); Andrés-Martínez, Pablo, Automated distribution of quantum circuits via hypergraph partitioning, Physical Review A, 100, 3, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","15700755","9783527606009; 9783527405411","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109818887"

To select the best features based on several conflicting objectives, feature selection can be modeled as a large-scale optimization problem. However, most existing multi-objective feature selection methods select the features based on minimizing two well-known objectives, the number of features and classification error, additional objectives can be considered to improve the classification performance. In this study, for the first time, a many-objective optimization method is proposed to select the efficient features for multi-label classification based on not only two mentioned objectives, but also maximizing the correlation between features and labels and minimizing the computational complexity of features. Maximizing the correlation could lead to increasing the accuracy of classification. On the other hand, selecting less complex features decreases the computational complexity of feature extraction phase. The most important aim of this paper is to tackle the multi-label feature selection based on the number of features, classification error, correlation between features and labels, and computational complexity of features, simultaneously. The conducted many-objective feature selection problem is solved using a proposed binary version of NSGA-III algorithm. The binary operator improves the exploration power of optimizer to search the large-scale space. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm (called binary NSGA-III), a benchmarking experiments is conducted on eight multi-label datasets in terms of several multi-objective assessment metrics, including Hypervolume indicator, Pure Diversity, and Set-coverage. Experimental results show significant improvements for proposed method in comparison with other algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature complexity; Feature selection; Information gain; Many-objective optimization; Multi-label classification","Computational complexity; Feature extraction; Accuracy of classifications; Classification performance; Correlation between features; Feature selection algorithm; Feature selection methods; Feature selection problem; Many-objective optimizations; Multi label classification; Classification (of information)","","","","Chen, Guibin, Ensemble application of convolutional and recurrent neural networks for multi-label text categorization, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2017-May, pp. 2377-2383, (2017); Wang, Jiang, CNN-RNN: A Unified Framework for Multi-label Image Classification, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 2285-2294, (2016); Li, Zejun, Gene function prediction based on combining gene ontology hierarchy with multi-instance multi-label learning, RSC Advances, 8, 50, pp. 28503-28509, (2018); Ueda, Naonori, Parametric mixture models for multi-labeled text, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2003); Boutell, Matthew R., Learning multi-label scene classification, Pattern Recognition, 37, 9, pp. 1757-1771, (2004); Li, Feng, Granular multi-label feature selection based on mutual information, Pattern Recognition, 67, pp. 410-423, (2017); Lee, Jaesung, Mutual Information-based multi-label feature selection using interaction information, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 4, pp. 2013-2025, (2015); Xue, Bing, Particle swarm optimization for feature selection in classification: A multi-objective approach, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 43, 6, pp. 1656-1671, (2013); Wang, Chiaming, Evolutionary-based feature selection approaches with new criteria for data mining: A case study of credit approval data, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3 PART 2, pp. 5900-5908, (2009); Hagenau, Michael, Automated news reading: Stock price prediction based on financial news using context-specific features, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1040-1049, (2012)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18688071; 1868808X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104265519"

Considered one of the most well-succeeded examples of such new strategies, the third version of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) uses a set of reference points placed on a normalized hyperplane to solve Many Objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs). Despite the good results of NSGA-III, the shape of the hypersurface can influence the algorithm’s performance and it has not been deeply explored in the recent literature. This work aims therefore at proposing a new hybrid algorithm and investigating nonlinear transformations applied to the NSGA-III hyperplane. We categorize our proposed approach as a hybrid MOEA (Indicator- and Pareto-based), and analyze the influence of the modified set of reference points on the proposed algorithm while solving MaOPs. The paper presents as its main contributions: (i) the proposal of a greedy indicator-based variant of NSGA-III that uses math transformations on a subset of chosen reference points; (ii) the use of Vector Guided Adaptation procedure to modify original NSGA-III hyperplane at every few iterations. A set of experiments addressing several benchmark problems is performed to evaluate the performance of the original and adapted NSGA-III versions, and also to compare them with two well known MOEAs, observing both, convergence and diversity of the final Pareto fronts. Based on the analysis of statistical tests, we conclude that the proposed approach is competitive and can provide an interesting alternative to the original NSGA-III conception. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Greedy algorithm; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Reference points","Benchmarking; Geometry; Mathematical transformations; Support vector machines; Bench-mark problems; Hybrid algorithms; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Non-linear transformations; Objective functions; Reference points; Genetic algorithms","","","This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001 and by the Universal CNPq grant, project number 425861/2016-3.

The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) still has such disadvantage even though it is recognized as an algorithm with good performance for many-objective problems. Thus, a variation of NSGA-III algorithm based on fine final level selection is proposed to improve convergence. The fine final level selection is designed in this way. The θ-dominance relation is used to sort the solutions in the critical layer firstly. Then I<inf>SDE</inf> index and favor convergence are employed to evaluate convergence of individuals for different situations. And some better solutions are selected finally. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is validated by comparing with nine state-of-the-art algorithms on the Deb-Thiele-Laumanns-Zitzler and Walking-Fish-Group test suits. And the optimization objectives are varying from 3 to 15. The performance is evaluated by the inverted generational distance (IGD), hypervolume (HV), generational distance (GD). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has an average improvement of 55.4%, 60.0%, 63.1% of 65 test instances for IGD, HV, GD indexes over the original NSGA-III algorithm. Besides, the proposed algorithm obtains the best performance by comparing 9 state-of-art algorithms in HV, GD indexes and ranks third for IGD indicator. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can achieve the advantages over the benchmarks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Environmental selection; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III","Artificial intelligence; Critical layer; Dominance relation; High-dimensional optimization; Level selection; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; State-of-the-art algorithms; Test instances; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No.51774228].","Li, Bingdong, Many-objective evolutionary algorithms: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 48, 1, (2015); Fu, Guangtao, Optimal design of water distribution systems using many-objective visual analytics, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management - ASCE, 139, 6, pp. 624-633, (2013); Zhu, Yingying, An improved NSGA-III algorithm for feature selection used in intrusion detection, Knowledge-Based Systems, 116, pp. 74-85, (2017); Zulvia, Ferani E., A many-objective gradient evolution algorithm for solving a green vehicle routing problem with time windows and time dependency for perishable products, Journal of Cleaner Production, 242, (2020); Li, Ke, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm based on dominance and decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 5, pp. 694-716, (2015); Zheng, Wei, An improved MOEA/D design for many-objective optimization problems, Applied Intelligence, 48, 10, pp. 3839-3861, (2018); Asafuddoula, Md, A decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for many objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 3, pp. 445-460, (2015); Wang, Rui, Localized Weighted Sum Method for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 22, 1, pp. 3-18, (2018); Li, Bingdong, Stochastic ranking algorithm for many-objective optimization based on multiple indicators, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 6, pp. 924-938, (2016); Pamulapati, Trinadh, ISDE +An Indicator for Multi and Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 23, 2, pp. 346-352, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","15737497; 0924669X","9780511611445; 9780521884280","APITE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098957043"

The function of E-NSGA III is to extract features and DAG-SVM for the purpose of classification of power quality events with minimum error. The non-stationary and non- linear nature of power quality disturbances makes it a suitable choice for E-NSGA III. This technique gives unique Pareto-optimal solutions based on multi-objective optimization. Considering equal priority for all the objectives, a fitness function is used to obtain the best solution set from the first Pareto front. Non-dominated sorting sets a dominated count and assigns domination to each individual. Dominated count means the number of times an individual data point has been dominated by another data point. The obtained unique feature vectors are used for training of DAG-SVM classifier to classify the power quality disturbances. Many power quality events including harmonics, swell, sag, transient, swell with harmonics and sag with harmonics are taken into consideration for investigation of power signal disturbances. Comparative investigation reveals the novelty and efficacy of the proposed hybrid technique in comparison of support vector machine, radial basis feed-forward neural network, probabilistic neural network, support vector machine and type-1 and type-II based fuzzy classifier under serve noise conditions. The simulation results show that the Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine gives the best classification accuracy of 99.20% and less computation time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DAG-SVM; E-NSGA-III; Power quality (PQ) events; Similarity matrix","","","","","Hajian, Mahdi, New automated power quality recognition system for online/offline monitoring, Neurocomputing, 128, pp. 389-406, (2014); Lee, Ian W.C., S-transform-based intelligent system for classification of power quality disturbance signals, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 50, 4, pp. 800-805, (2003); Uyar, Murat, An effective wavelet-based feature extraction method for classification of power quality disturbance signals, Electric Power Systems Research, 78, 10, pp. 1747-1755, (2008); Thirumala, Karthik, Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform and Dual Multiclass SVM for Online Automatic Detection of Power Quality Disturbances, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 9, 4, pp. 3018-3028, (2018); Singh, Utkarsh, Optimal Feature Selection via NSGA-II for Power Quality Disturbances Classification, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14, 7, pp. 2994-3002, (2018); Rodriguez-Guerrero, Marco Antonio, Hybrid Approach Based on GA and PSO for Parameter Estimation of a Full Power Quality Disturbance Parameterized Model, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14, 3, pp. 1016-1028, (2018); Li, Jianmin, Detection and Classification of Power Quality Disturbances Using Double Resolution S-Transform and DAG-SVMs, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 65, 10, pp. 2302-2312, (2016); Ahmadi, Hamed, Design of joint active and reactive power reserve market: A multi-objective approach using NSGA II, IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution, 10, 1, pp. 31-40, (2016); Ji, Bin, Orthogonal Design-Based NSGA-III for the Optimal Lockage Co-Scheduling Problem, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 18, 8, pp. 2085-2095, (2017); Ben Abid, Firas, Distinct bearing faults detection in induction motor by a hybrid optimized SWPT and aiNet-DAG SVM, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 33, 4, pp. 1692-1699, (2018)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","25208446; 25208438","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134695854"

The objective functions of the model consider the computation and storage resource utilization rate, load balancing rate, and actual microservice usage rate in resource service centres. The constraints of the model are the completeness of service, total amount of storage resources, and total number of microservices. In this study, a knowledge-driven evolutionary algorithm (named MGR-NSGA-III) is proposed to solve the problem model and seek the optimal deployment and startup strategy of microservice instances in different resource centres. The proposed model and solution have been evaluated via real data experiments. The results show that our approach is better than the traditional microservice instance deployment and startup strategy. The average computation rate, storage idle rate, and actual microservice idle rate were 13.21%, 5.2%, and 16.67% lower than those in NSGA-III, respectively.

These problems have been solved by many evolutionary algorithms like MOEA/D, NSGA-III, and KnEA. However, when the numbers of decision variables and objectives increase, the computation costs of those mentioned algorithms will be unaffordable. To reduce such high computation cost on large-scale many-objective optimization problems, we proposed a two-stage framework. The first stage of the proposed algorithm combines with a multi-tasking optimization strategy and a bi-directional search strategy, where the original problem is reformulated as a multi-tasking optimization problem in the decision space to enhance the convergence. To improve the diversity, in the second stage, the proposed algorithm applies multi-tasking optimization to a number of sub-problems based on reference points in the objective space. In this paper, to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we test the algorithm on the DTLZ and LSMOP problems and compare it with existing algorithms, and it outperforms other compared algorithms in most cases and shows disadvantage on both convergence and diversity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithms; Large-scale optimization; Many-objective optimization; Multi-tasking optimization","","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 61976165)","Complex Intell Syst, (2017); Coello, Carlos A., Evolutionary multiobjective optimization: open research areas and some challenges lying ahead, Complex and Intelligent Systems, 6, 2, pp. 221-236, (2020); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, (2001); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Zitzler, Eckart, Indicator-based selection in multiobjective search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3242, pp. 832-842, (2004); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Bader, Johannes, HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 45-76, (2011); Yang, Shengxiang, A grid-based evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 17, 5, pp. 721-736, (2013); Wang, Rui, Preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithms for many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 17, 4, pp. 474-494, (2013)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","21994536; 21986053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116736819"

The authors define it as a sustainable flexible job shop scheduling problem considering dual resources (SFJSPCDR). First, a model of the SFJSPCDR is formulated to optimise the makespan, the energy consumption, and the ergonomic risk simultaneously. Second, an improved survival duration-guided NSGA-III algorithm (SDG-NSGA-III) is proposed to solve SFJSPCDR. The survival duration of each individual determines whether it takes part in generating offspring. In order to balance the energy consumption and ergonomic risk while minimising the makespan, a double-low decoding algorithm is proposed, which is composed of two decoding algorithms. Cross-generation selection is employed with the non-dominated sorting, and the next-generation population is selected according to the reference point-based selection strategy. In addition, a restart strategy is also integrated to improve the exploration and exploitation performance of the SDG-NSGA-III algorithm. Finally, a group of experiments are carried out and the results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Decoding; Energy utilization; Ergonomics; Optimization; Planning; Scheduling; Sustainable development; Decoding algorithm; Dual resource; Exploration and exploitation; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Indicators of sustainable development; Non-dominated Sorting; Reference points; Restart strategy; Job shop scheduling","","","Supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant (51,305,024) and in part by the National Key R & D plan under Grant (No. 2020YFB1712902)","Journal of Business Ethics, (2000); Staniskiene, Eglė, Social sustainability measurement framework: The case of employee perspective in a CSR-committed organisation, Journal of Cleaner Production, 188, pp. 708-719, (2018); Gong, Guiliang, A new double flexible job-shop scheduling problem integrating processing time, green production, and human factor indicators, Journal of Cleaner Production, 174, pp. 560-576, (2018); Neumann, W.

However, the design of GUIs has mostly been a manual activity. To design a GUI, the designer must select its visual, spatial, textual, and interaction properties such that the combination strikes a balance among the relevant human factors. While emerging computational-design techniques have addressed some problems related to grid layouts, no general approach has been proposed that can also produce good and complete results covering color-related decisions and other nonlinear design objectives. Evolutionary algorithms are promising and demonstrate good handling of similar problems in other conditions, genetic operators, depending on how they are designed. But even these approaches struggle with elements' overlap and hence produce too many infeasible candidate solutions. This paper presents a new approach based on grid-based genetic operators demonstrated in a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) setting. The operators use grid lines for element positions in a novel manner to satisfy overlap-related constraints and intrinsically improve the alignment of elements. This approach can be used for crossovers and mutations. Its core benefit is that all the solutions generated satisfy the no-overlap requirement and represent well-formed layouts. The new operators permit using genetic algorithms for increasingly realistic task instances, responding to more design objectives than could be considered before. Specifically, we address grid quality, alignment, selection time, clutter minimization, saliency control, color harmony, and grouping of elements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fitts' law; gestalt law; graphical layout problem; grid-based genetic operators; many-objective optimization; user interfaces","Alignment; Graphical user interfaces; Computational design; Design objectives; Genetic operators; Graphical user interface (GUIs); Interaction properties; Layout generations; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Non-linear design; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was supported by the Technology Industries of Finland (SOWP) grant number 700047 and the Academy of Finland (Human Automata) grant number 328813.","Albayrak, Murat, Development a new mutation operator to solve the traveling salesman problem by aid of genetic algorithms, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 3, pp. 1313-1320, (2011); Angus, Daniel J., Multiple objective ant colony optimisation, Swarm Intelligence, 3, 1, pp. 69-85, (2009); Arcuri, Andrea, A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1-10, (2011); Management Science, (1963); Bechikh, Slim, Many-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms: A survey, Adaptation, Learning, and Optimization, 20, pp. 105-137, (2017); European Journal of Operational Research, (2020); Semiology of Graphics, (1983); Bier, Eric Allan, SNAP-DRAGGING., Computer Graphics (ACM), 20, 4, pp. 233-240, (1986); Bouzit, Sara, A design space for engineering graphical adaptive menus, pp. 239-244, (2016); Castillo, Ignacio, Optimization of block layout design problems with unequal areas: A comparison of MILP and MINLP optimization methods, Computers and Chemical Engineering, 30, 1, pp. 54-69, (2005)","","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","25730142","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107348198"

However, most of the existing research has focused on the double-objective project scheduling problem, while literature on project scheduling problems with more than two objectives is rather scarce. In this paper, the typical multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is extended to a new triple-objective multi-mode project scheduling problem (TOMPSP) with the objectives of minimizing the project duration, minimizing the resource investment and maximizing the robustness of the schedule. To solve the presented triple-objective problem, we resort to the latest version of the multi-objective genetic algorithm, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). In the decoding process of the NSGA-III, a modified SSGS (serial schedule generation scheme), in which resource constraints are relaxed, is suggested by considering the delays of activities. Although the NSGA-III shows excellent performance in numerous multi-objective optimization problems with more than two objectives, it has a potential disadvantage in that it occasionally cannot find the intercept during the adaptive normalization process, and thus, the population cannot be normalized as expected. Since a case without an intercept is impossible in the NSGA-II, we adopt the NSGA-II normalization process rather than that of NSGA-III. The standard instances in PSPLib are modified to serve as the instances of the TOMPSP, and a computational experiment is conducted to test the algorithms. The results show that the presented algorithm not only greatly simplifies the implementation of the NSGA-III but also significantly improves the execution efficiency and calculation quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fast non-dominant genetic algorithm; Multi-mode project scheduling; Multi-objective optimization; Robustness scheduling","Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling; Computational experiment; Multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objective project scheduling; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Project scheduling problem; Serial schedule generation scheme; Genetic algorithms","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 71671117, 71831006 and 71971173.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 71671117, 71831006 and 71971173, and the Key R & D Program of Shandong under Grant No. 2019JZZY010122.","Al-Fawzan, Mohammad A., A bi-objective model for robust resource-constrained project scheduling, International Journal of Production Economics, 96, 2, pp. 175-187, (2005); Bi, Xiaojun, An improved NSGA-III algorithm based on elimination operator for many-objective optimization, Memetic Computing, 9, 4, pp. 361-383, (2017); Chen, Weineng, Scheduling multi-mode projects under uncertainty to optimize cash flows: A Monte Carlo ant colony system approach, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 27, 5, pp. 950-965, (2012); Chtourou, Hédi, A two-stage-priority-rule-based algorithm for robust resource-constrained project scheduling, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 55, 1, pp. 183-194, (2008); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Theoretical Advances and Applications, (2005); Gutjahr, Walter J., Bi-objective multi-mode project scheduling under risk aversion, European Journal of Operational Research, 246, 2, pp. 421-434, (2015); Hartmann, Sönke, Project Scheduling with Multiple Modes: A Genetic Algorithm, Annals of Operations Research, 102, 1-4, pp. 111-135, (2001)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18659292; 18659284","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107243118"

Present day cloud resource and service providers use a heterogeneous allocation strategy for resources allocation across various geographical locations. Further, these allocations are completely in need of secure transactions, effective scheduling and dynamic resource allocation strategies. To overcome the above mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel resource allocation framework for the cloud service providers to schedule and effective resource allocation. The key idea of the proposed resource allocation scheme is to utilize Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) to effectively allocate resources. Furthermore, the proposed NSGA-III is modified to support any interim data sources (any middle wares). The proposed model is experimentally validated in the test bed with multi-node Hadoop cluster.

Devices can transmit computation tasks to servers to be executed through computation offloading. However, not all the computation tasks can be offloaded to servers with the limitation of network conditions. Therefore, it is very important to decide quickly how many tasks should be executed on servers and how many should be executed locally. Only computation tasks that are properly of-floaded can improve the Quality of Service (QoS). Some existing methods only focus on a single objection, and of the others some have high computational complexity. There still have no method that could balance the targets and complexity for universal application. In this study, a Mul-ti‐Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) based on time and energy consumption is proposed to solve the optimal offloading mechanism of computation offloading in mobile edge computing. It is the first time that MOWOA has been applied in this area. For improving the quality of the solution set, crowding degrees are introduced and all solutions are sorted by crowding degrees. Additionally, an improved MOWOA (MOWOA2) by using the gravity reference point method is proposed to obtain better diversity of the solution set. Compared with some typical approaches, such as the Grid‐Based Evolutionary Algorithm (GrEA), Cluster‐Gradient‐based Artificial Immune System Algorithm (CGbAIS), Non‐dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA‐III), etc., the MOWOA2 performs better in terms of the quality of the final solutions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computation offloading; Edge computing; Multi‐objective; Whale optimization algorithm","Complex networks; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Green computing; Quality of service; Artificial immune system algorithms; Computation offloading; Computation tasks; Network condition; Optimization algorithms; Reference point method; Sorting genetic algorithm; Universal application; Clustering algorithms; article; Cetacea; controlled study; crowding (area); energy consumption; genetic algorithm; gravity; immune system; nonhuman","","","This research was funded by National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1404400 and Grant 2018YFB1703403 and the Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 2019CXTD400, Hainan Key R&D Program under Grant ZDYF2019115, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61865005, the Open Project Program of Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics under Grant 2020WNLOKF001, Key R&D Project of Hainan province under Grant ZDYF2019020, National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62062030, and the Education Department of Hainan Province under Grant Hnky2019‐22.","Botta, Alessio, Integration of Cloud computing and Internet of Things: A survey, Future Generation Computer Systems, 56, pp. 684-700, (2016); Shi, Weisong, Edge Computing: Vision and Challenges, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 3, 5, pp. 637-646, (2016); Román, Rodrigo, Mobile edge computing, Fog et al.: A survey and analysis of security threats and challenges, Future Generation Computer Systems, 78, pp. 680-698, (2018); Bajic, Bojana, Edge computing vs. Cloud computing: Challenges and opportunities in industry 4.0, Annals of DAAAM and Proceedings of the International DAAAM Symposium, 30, 1, pp. 864-871, (2019); Chen, Min, Edge cognitive computing based smart healthcare system, Future Generation Computer Systems, 86, pp. 403-411, (2018); Hassan, Najmul, The Role of Edge Computing in Internet of Things, IEEE Communications Magazine, 56, 11, pp. 110-115, (2018); Tang, Yu, A survey on the 5G network and its impact on agriculture: Challenges and opportunities, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 180, (2021); Hmimz, Youssef, Bi-objective optimization for multi-task offloading in latency and radio resources constrained mobile edge computing networks, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 80, 11, pp. 17129-17166, (2021); Shakarami, Ali, A review on the computation offloading approaches in mobile edge computing: A game-theoretic perspective, Software - Practice and Experience, 50, 9, pp. 1719-1759, (2020); Shakarami, Ali, A survey on the computation offloading approaches in mobile edge computing: A machine learning-based perspective, Computer Networks, 182, (2020)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","14248220","","","33918037","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103817172"

Unfortunately, it has been observed that many of MOOs experiences performance degradation when applied over MOPs having a large number of decision variables and objective functions. Specially, the performance of MOOs rapidly decreases when the number of decision variables and objective functions increases by more than a hundred and three, respectively. To address the challenges caused by such special case of MOPs, some large-scale multi-objective optimization optimizers (L-MuOOs) and large-scale many-objective optimization optimizers (L-MaOOs) have been developed in the literature. Even after vast development in the direction of L-MuOOs and L-MaOOs, the supremacy of these optimizers has not been tested on real-world optimization problems containing a large number of decision variables and objectives such as large-scale many-objective software clustering problems (L-MaSCPs). In this study, the performance of nine L-MuOOs and L-MaOOs (i.e., S3-CMA-ES, LMOSCO, LSMOF, LMEA, IDMOPSO, ADC-MaOO, NSGA-III, H-RVEA, and DREA) is evaluated and compared over five L-MaSCPs in terms of IGD, Hypervolume, and MQ metrics. The experimentation results show that the S3-CMA-ES and LMOSCO perform better compared to the LSMOF, LMEA, IDMOPSO, ADC-MaOO, NSGA-III, H-RVEA, and DREA in most of the cases. The LSMOF, LMEA, IDMOPSO, ADC-MaOO, NSGA-III, and DREA, are the average performer, and H-RVEA is the worst performer. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large-scale optimization; Many-objective optimization; Pareto optimality; Software clustering","","","","","Nature Inspired Optimization of Large Problems, (2016); Cheng, Ran, Test Problems for Large-Scale Multiobjective and Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 47, 12, pp. 4108-4121, (2017); Zhang, Xingyi, A knee point-driven evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 6, pp. 761-776, (2015); Chen, Huangke, Solving large-scale many-objective optimization problems by covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy with scalable small subpopulations, Information Sciences, 509, pp. 457-469, (2020); Farina, Marco, On the optimal solution definition for many-criteria optimization problems, Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society - NAFIPS, 2002-January, pp. 233-238, (2002); Figueiredo, Elliackin M.N., Many Objective Particle Swarm Optimization, Information Sciences, 374, pp. 115-134, (2016); Cheng, Ran, A competitive swarm optimizer for large scale optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 45, 2, pp. 191-204, (2015); Zhang, Xingyi, A Decision Variable Clustering-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Large-Scale Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 22, 1, pp. 97-112, (2018); Wang, Handing, Two Arch2: An Improved Two-Archive Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 4, pp. 524-541, (2015); Zille, Heiner, A Framework for Large-Scale Multiobjective Optimization Based on Problem Transformation, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 22, 2, pp. 260-275, (2018)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","21994536; 21986053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125608150"

As the major data source of industrial CIoV, social media has a significant impact on the quality of service (QoS) of the automotive industry. To provide vehicular social media services with low latency and high reliability, edge computing is adopted to complement cloud computing by offloading CC tasks to the edge of the network. Generally, task offloading is implemented based on the premise that edge servers (ESs) are appropriately quantified and located. However, the quantification of ESs is often offered according to empirical knowledge, lacking analysis on real condition of intelligent transportation system (ITS). To address the abovementioned problem, a collaborative method for the quantification and placement of ESs, named CQP, is developed for social media services in industrial CIoV.

One form of collaboration is the sharing of logistics resources (e.g., delivery vehicles). Existing studies on collaboration and resource sharing have not sufficiently accounted for the time frame within which collaboration happens, and they mostly assume that collaboration among logistics operators occurs in a single time period. This study addresses the issue of collaboration across multiple time periods, in which logistics resources can be shared between different service time periods, by formulating and solving a two-echelon collaborative multi-depot multi-period vehicle routing problem (2E-CMDPVRP). The 2E-CMDPVRP is formulated as a multi-objective integer programming model that minimizes logistics operational costs, service waiting times, and number of vehicles in multiple service periods. A hybrid heuristic algorithm with three-dimensional k-means clustering and improved reference point-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (IR-NSGA-III) is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization model. Comparative analysis results show that the proposed IR-NSGA-III outperforms existing algorithms in terms of the minimization of logistics operational costs, service waiting times, and number of vehicles. The minimum costs remaining saving method and strictly monotonic path selection principle are combined to determine the best profit allocation schemes and the optimal coalition sequences. An empirical case study of a multi-depot multi-period logistics network in Chongqing, China, is used to validate the proposed model and solution algorithm. Results suggest that the proposed collaborative mechanism with multi-depot and multi-period resource sharing can improve the degree of synchronization within a collaborative logistics network, and thus contribute to sustainable development of urban logistics distribution networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative mechanism; Degree of synchronization; K-means clustering; Multi-depot multi-period vehicle routing problem; Resource sharing","Cost benefit analysis; Freight transportation; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; K-means clustering; Multiobjective optimization; Three dimensional computer graphics; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Collaborative logistics networks; Hybrid heuristic algorithms; Integer programming models; Minimum costs-remaining savings; Multi-objective optimization models; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Transportation efficiency; Vehicle Routing Problems; Costs","","","This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71871035 ), Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 18YJC630189), Key Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJZD-K202000702), Social Science Planning Foundation of Chongqing of China (2019YBGL054), and Key Project of Human Social Science of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (20SKGH079), This research is supported by 2018 Chongqing Liuchuang Plan Innovation Project (cx2018111).","Adelzadeh, Mehdi, A mathematical model and a solving procedure for multi-depot vehicle routing problem with fuzzy time window and heterogeneous vehicle, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 75, 5-8, pp. 793-802, (2014); Adhikari, Arnab, Collaboration, bargaining, and fairness concern for a green apparel supply chain: An emerging economy perspective, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 135, (2020); Alikar, Najmeh, Application of the NSGA-II algorithm to a multi-period inventory-redundancy allocation problem in a series-parallel system, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 160, pp. 1-10, (2017); Athanasopoulos, Theodore, Efficient techniques for the multi-period vehicle routing problem with time windows within a branch and price framework, Annals of Operations Research, 206, 1, pp. 1-22, (2013); Audy, Jean François, An empirical study on coalition formation and cost/savings allocation, International Journal of Production Economics, 136, 1, pp. 13-27, (2012); Bae, Heechul, Multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time windows considering delivery and installation vehicles, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 40, 13-14, pp. 6536-6549, (2016); Basten, Rob, Near-optimal heuristics to set base stock levels in a two-echelon distribution network, International Journal of Production Economics, 143, 2, pp. 546-552, (2013); Braekers, Kris, Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 67, pp. 166-186, (2014); Cantu-Funes, Roberto, Multi-depot periodic vehicle routing problem with due dates and time windows, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 69, 2, pp. 296-306, (2018); Al Chami, Zaher, An advanced GRASP-HGA combination to solve a multi-period Pickup and Delivery Problem, Expert Systems with Applications, 105, pp. 262-272, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096561793"

Yet, design problems often have objective functions and constraints that are expensive and highly nonlinear. Combinations of these features lead to poor convergence and diversity loss with common algorithms that have not been specifically designed for constrained optimization. Constrained benchmark problems exist, but they do not necessarily represent the challenges of engineering problems. In this article, a framework to design electro-mechanical actuators, called multiobjective design of actuators (MODAct), is presented and 20 constrained multiobjective optimization test problems are derived from the framework with a specific focus on constraints. The full source code is made available to ease its use. The effects of the constraints are analyzed through their impact on the Pareto front as well as on the convergence performance. A constraint landscape analysis approach is followed and extended with three new metrics to characterize the search and objective spaces. The features of MODAct are compared to existing test suites to highlight the differences. In addition, a convergence analysis using NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and C-TAEA on MODAct and existing test suites suggests that the design problems are indeed difficult due to the constraints. In particular, the number of simultaneously violated constraints in newly generated solutions seems key in understanding the convergence challenges. Thus, MODAct offers an efficient framework to analyze and handle constraints in future optimization algorithm design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constraint handling; evolutionary algorithm; multiobjective optimization; real-world problems; test suites","Benchmarking; Economic and social effects; Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical devices; Mechanical actuators; Multiobjective optimization; Bench-mark problems; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Convergence analysis; Convergence performance; Engineering problems; Landscape analysis; Objective functions; Optimization algorithms; Constrained optimization","","","Manuscript received February 6, 2020; revised May 13, 2020 and July 14, 2020; accepted August 24, 2020.

The first stage performs a mono-objective optimization in order to reach, with sufficient dexterity, a regular target workspace while minimizing the elements’ lengths. For this optimization problem, we compare three bio-inspired algorithms: the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the Boltzman Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (BUMDA). The second stage looks for the most suitable gains of a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control via the minimization of two conflicting objectives: one based on energy consumption and the tracking error of a target trajectory. To this effect, we compare two multi-objective algorithms: the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III). The main contributions lie in the optimization model, the proposal of a two-stage optimization method, and the findings of the performance of different bio-inspired algorithms for each stage.

This alteration usually deteriorates the perception quality of the image. The central challenge in image denoising corresponds to eliminating the corrupted information while it is maintained the fine features of the original image. Anisotropic Diffusion (AD) is considered a well-established scheme for removing noise in digital images without deteriorating their edges. The selection of parameters that define the AD operation presents a very decisive implication in the filtering results. In spite of the importance of the AD operation, the problem of automatically calculating its parameter according to the image requirements has been scarcely considered in the literature. In this paper, a new multi-objective methodology to obtain the AD parameters for effective filter results is presented. In the proposed approach, the appropriate AD parameter values are obtained as the solution that involves the best possible trade-off between two conflicting scenarios: To minimize the noise content in the image while the contrast is maximized. Both objectives cannot be individually improved without worsening another. The proposed scheme uses to solve this formulation of the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based on reference points (NSGA-III), which represent one of the most robust and powerful algorithms for multi-objective optimization. Then, the final solution is obtained from an analysis of the Optimal Pareto front. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method presents better results than existing filtering algorithms in terms of visual quality and standard performance metrics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anisotropic diffusion; Evolutionary computation; Multi-objective optimization; Noise reduction","Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optical anisotropy; Anisotropic Diffusion; Anisotropic diffusion filtering; Filtering algorithm; Multi objective; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Reference points; Standard performance; Visual qualities; Image denoising","","","","Abdolrazzagh-Nezhad, Majid, Enhanced cultural algorithm to solve multi-objective attribute reduction based on rough set theory, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 170, pp. 332-350, (2020); Alghafis, Abdullah A., An efficient image encryption scheme based on chaotic and Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 177, pp. 441-466, (2020); Alvarez, Luis, Image selective smoothing and edge detection by nonlinear diffusion.

To address such optimization problems, a number of evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithms were developed recently. In this paper, we tested 18 evolutionary many-objective algorithms against well-known combinatorial optimization problems, including knapsack problem (MOKP), traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), and quadratic assignment problem (mQAP), all up to 10 objectives. Results show that some of the dominance and reference-based algorithms such as non-dominated sort genetic algorithm (NSGA-III), strength Pareto-based evolutionary algorithm based on reference direction (SPEA/R), and Grid-based evolutionary algorithm (GrEA) are promising algorithms to tackle MOKP and MOTSP with 5 and 10 while increasing the number of objectives. Also, the dominance-based algorithms such as MaOEA-DDFC as well as the indicator-based algorithms such as HypE are promising to solve mQAP with 5 and 10 objectives. In contrast, decomposition based algorithms present the best on almost problems at saving time. For example, t-DEA displayed superior performance on MOTSP for up to 10 objectives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Traveling salesman problem; Combinatorial optimization problems; Comparative studies; Grid-based; Knapsack problems; Many-objective optimizations; Non-dominated sorts; Optimization problems; Quadratic assignment problems; Combinatorial mathematics","","","","Tian, Ye, An Indicator-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm with Reference Point Adaptation for Better Versatility, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 22, 4, pp. 609-622, (2018); He, Cheng, A radial space division based evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, Applied Soft Computing, 61, pp. 603-621, (2017); Li, Tengfei, Using Modified Determinantal Point Process Sampling to Update Population, (2018); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Multi-objective optimization, pp. 403-450, (2014); Marler, R.

In this paper, we propose two variants of a three-objective function optimization formulation using a customized non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) to find community structures in a network. The first variant, named NSGA-III-KRM, considered Kernel k-means, ratio cut, and modularity, as three objective functions; whereas the second variant, named NSGA-III-CCM, considers community score, community fitness and modularity, as three objective functions. Experiments are conducted on four benchmark network datasets. Comparison with state-of-the-art and baseline methods along with decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm variants (MOEA/D-KRM and MOEA/D-CCM) indicates that the proposed variants yield comparable or better results. This is particularly significant because the addition of the third objective does not worsen the results of the other two objectives. We also propose a simple method to rank the Pareto solutions obtained by proposing a new measure—the ratio of the hyper-volume and inverted generational distance. The higher the ratio, the better is the Pareto set. This strategy is particularly useful in the absence of empirical attainment function in the multi-objective framework, where the number of objectives is more than two. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Community detection; Community fitness; Community score; Kernel k means; Modularity; Multi-objective optimization; NMI; NSGA-III; Ratio cut","","","","With thanks to Manfred Laubichler and Richard Creath, and the National Science Foundation for support through numerous grants.","Javed, Muhammad Aqib, Community detection in networks: A multidisciplinary review, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 108, pp. 87-111, (2018); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Newman, Mark E.J., Fast algorithm for detecting community structure in networks, Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics, 69, 6 2, pp. 1-66133, (2004); Blondel, Vincent, Fast unfolding of communities in large networks, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008, 10, (2008); Pizzuti, Clara, GA-Net: A genetic algorithm for community detection in social networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5199 LNCS, pp. 1081-1090, (2008); Gong, Maoguo, Memetic algorithm for community detection in networks, Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics, 84, 5, (2011); Li, Zhenping, Quantitative function for community detection, Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics, 77, 3, (2008); Shang, Ronghua, Community detection based on modularity and an improved genetic algorithm, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 392, 5, pp. 1215-1231, (2013); Pizzuti, Clara, A multiobjective genetic algorithm to find communities in complex networks, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 16, 3, pp. 418-430, (2012); Gong, Maoguo, Complex network clustering by multiobjective discrete particle swarm optimization based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 1, pp. 82-97, (2014)","","Springer","","","","","","26618907; 2662995X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119265685"

This is mainly because the population size cannot be set to an arbitrarily large value if the computational efficiency is of concern. In such a case, the distance between the parents becomes remarkably large and, consequently, it is not easy to reproduce a superior offspring in high-dimensional objective space. To alleviate this problem, an elite gene-guided (EGG) reproduction operator is proposed to tackle MaOPs in this article. In this operator, an elite gene pool is built by collecting the knee points from the current population. Then, the offspring is produced by exchanging the genes with this elite gene pool under an exchange rate, aiming to reserve more promising genes into the next generation. In order to provide new genes for the population, other genes will be disturbed under a disturbance rate. The settings and functional analysis of the exchange rate and disturbance rate are studied using several experiments. The proposed EGG operator is easy to implement and can be embedded to any MaOEA. As examples, we show the embedding of the proposed EGG operator into four competitive MaOEAs, that is, MOEA/D, NSGA-III, \theta -DEA, and SPEA2-SDE provide some advantages over simulated binary crossover, differential evolution, and an evolutionary path-based reproduction operator on solving a number of benchmark problems with 3 to 15 objectives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crossover operator; evolutionary algorithm; evolutionary operator; many-objective optimization; recombination operator","Cell proliferation; Computational efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Finance; Optimization; Population statistics; Bench-mark problems; Differential Evolution; Evolutionary path; High-dimensional; Many-objective optimizations; Population sizes; Reproduction operator; Simulated binary crossover; Genes; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biological model; decision making; molecular evolution; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making; Evolution, Molecular; Models, Genetic","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61876110, Grant 61672358, and Grant 61836005, in part by the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China through Key Program under Grant U1713212, and in part by the Fundamental Research Project in the Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen under Grant JCYJ20170817102218122, Grant GFW2018021118145859, and Grant JSGG20180507182904693","Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Ikeda, Kokolo, Failure of Pareto-based MOEAs: Does non-dominated really mean near to optimal?, 2, pp. 957-962, (2001); Yang, Shengxiang, A grid-based evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 17, 5, pp. 721-736, (2013); He, Zhenan, Fuzzy-based pareto optimality for many-objective evolutionary algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 2, pp. 269-285, (2014); Yuan, Yuan, A New Dominance Relation-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 1, pp. 16-37, (2016); Elarbi, Maha, A New Decomposition-Based NSGA-II for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 48, 7, pp. 1191-1210, (2018); Tian, Ye, A Strengthened Dominance Relation Considering Convergence and Diversity for Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 23, 2, pp. 331-345, (2019); Bader, Johannes, HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 45-76, (2011); Zitzler, Eckart, Indicator-based selection in multiobjective search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3242, pp. 832-842, (2004)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21682267; 21682275","","","31484147","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090718826"

WSN usage for monitoring and tracing applications shows massive acceleration, whether indoors or outdoors. WSN is constructed from interconnected sensors, limited resource (battery), which requires considerable importance on deployment and routing strategies, to improve the performance of Quality of Service (QoS) in WSNs. Many of the existing strategies are based on metaheuristics algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms to resolve the problem. This research proposes a new algorithm, Enhanced Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Routing Algorithm (ENSGRA), to improve the QoS in WSNs. The proposed algorithm relies on Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 3 (NSGA-III), but adjusts reference points through the use of a dynamic weighted clustered scheduled vector to obtain new solutions.

The main issue relates to the considerable combinatorial complexity of the tasks of operational planning. Another problem is that as part of the conventional approach, planning a station operation and planning a local operation at it is considered separately. Another planning issue is the lack of high-quality models for the preparation of initial data, in particular, data on the duration of technological operations, such as, for example, shunting operations involving local wagons forwarding. To resolve these issues, a new approach has been proposed, under which the tasks of operative planning of a technical station’s operation and its subsystem of local operations are tackled simultaneously, based on a single model. To this end, a mathematical model of vector combinatoric optimization has been built, which uses the criteria of total operating costs and wagon-hours spent at a station when forwarding local wagon flows, in the form of separate objective functions. Within this model, a predictive model was constructed in the form of a fuzzy inference system. This model is designed to determine the duration of shunting half-runs when executing the spotting/picking operations for delivering local wagons to enterprises’ goods sheds. The model provides for the accuracy level that would suffice at planning, in contrast to classical methods. A procedure has been devised for optimizing the planning model, which employs the modern genetic algorithm of vector optimization NSGA-III. This procedure is implemented in the form of software that makes it possible to build a rational operative plan for the operation of a technical station, including a subsystem of local operations, in graphic form, thereby reducing the operating costs by 5 % and the duration of maintenance of a local wagon by 8 %. The resulting effect could reduce the turnover time of a freight car in general on the railroad network, speed up the delivery of goods, and reduce the cost of transportation © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","optimization of local operations; combinatorial vector optimization; railroad connecting lines; shunting half-run; technical station","","","","","Bielli, Maurizio, Trends in models and algorithms for fleet management, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 20, pp. 4-18, (2011); Halldórsson, Árni, Last-mile logistics fulfilment: A framework for energy efficiency, Research in Transportation Business and Management, 37, (2020); Mira, Luís, Maintenance scheduling within rolling stock planning in railway operations under uncertain maintenance durations, Journal of Rail Transport Planning and Management, 14, (2020); Butko, Tetiana, Organization of railway freight short-haul transportation on the basis of logistic approaches, Procedia Computer Science, 149, pp. 102-109, (2019); Lin, Boliang, Integrating traffic routing optimization and train formation plan using simulated annealing algorithm, Applied Mathematical Modelling, 93, pp. 811-830, (2021); Bruck, Bruno Petrato, Integrated inbound train split and load planning in an intermodal railway terminal, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 145, pp. 270-289, (2021); Shi, Tie, A mixed integer programming model for optimizing multi-level operations process in railroad yards, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 80, pp. 19-39, (2015); Gestrelius, Sara, Towards a comprehensive model for track allocation and roll-time scheduling at marshalling yards, Journal of Rail Transport Planning and Management, 7, 3, pp. 157-170, (2017); Science and Transport Progress Bulletin of Dnipropetrovsk National University of Railway Transport, (2013); Panchenko, Artem, Predicting the estimated time of cargo dispatch from a marshaling yard, Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies, 4, 3-106, pp. 6-15, (2020)","","Technology Center","","","","","","17294061; 17293774","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109460788"

An 800-watt Extraction Water Machine (EWM) is fabricated and operates on the well-known “vapor compression cycle” to extract water from the air in an area that has low relative humidity.

First, the optimal tuning of cost-effective fuzzy controllers represented by Takagi–Sugeno–Kang proportional-integral fuzzy controllers (TSK PI-FCs) is carried out using a fresh metaheuristic algorithm, namely the Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), and a fuzzy controller tuning approach is offered. Second, a relatively easily understandable formulation of SMA is offered. Third, a real-world application of SMA is given, focusing on the optimal tuning of TSK PI-FCs for nonlinear servo systems in terms of optimization problems that target the minimization of discrete-time cost functions defined as the sum of time multiplied by squared control error.

The proposed formulation keeps into account system observability with and without contingencies due to single-line and PMU faults. Also, it includes the effect of possible zero-injection buses and a-priori constraints on both the number of PMU channels and the type of PMU measurements performed at each bus. Due to the nonlinear combinatorial nature of the proposed OPP problem, this is solved through a custom implementation of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The analysis of the proposed OPP strategy is focused on distribution systems. The placement results obtained using four test systems of different size show that increasing the number of buses instrumented with PMUs and/or the number of PMU channels beyond given thresholds just leads to larger costs with negligible further reductions in both state estimation uncertainty and sensitivity to line parameters tolerances. Moreover, if PMUs with just two three-phase channels are used, we can avoid instrumenting between 30% and 40% of buses with a minor impact on state estimation performance even in the case of contingencies. This percentage can be slightly increased if multi-channel PMUs are used. However, this choice generally is not profitable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distribution system state estimation; multi-objective optimization; optimal PMU placement; phasor measurement unit (PMU); power systems monitoring","Buses; Fits and tolerances; Genetic algorithms; Phasor measurement units; State estimation; Uncertainty analysis; Distribution systems; Estimation uncertainties; Line parameters; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Phasor measurement unit (PMUs); PMU measurements; System observability; Zero injections; Parameter estimation","","","This work was supported in part by the Project ‘‘Dipartimenti di eccellenza-2018–2022’’ funded by the Italian Ministry for University and Research.","De La Ree, Jaime, Synchronized phasor measurement applications in power systems, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 1, 1, pp. 20-27, (2010); Macii, David, Design criteria of digital filters for synchrophasor estimation, Conference Record - IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference, pp. 1579-1584, (2013); Blair, Steven M., Measurement and Analysis of PMU Reporting Latency for Smart Grid Protection and Control Applications, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 48689-48698, (2019); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Bandyopadhyay, Susmita, Solving a tri-objective supply chain problem with modified NSGA-II algorithm, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 33, 1, pp. 41-50, (2014); Sexauer, Jason M., Phasor measurement units for the distribution grid: Necessity and benefits, (2013); von Meier, Alexandra, Precision Micro-Synchrophasors for Distribution Systems: A Summary of Applications, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 8, 6, pp. 2926-2936, (2017); Romano, Paolo, A high-performance, low-cost PMU prototype for distribution networks based on FPGA, (2017); Nuqui, Reynaldo F., Phasor measurement unit placement techniques for complete and incomplete observability, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 20, 4, pp. 2381-2388, (2005); Baldwin, Thomas L., Power System Observability with Minimal Phasor Measurement Placement, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 8, 2, pp. 707-715, (1993)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104581448"

In this method, the related structure parameters are optimised. A many-objective algorithm is employed as the optimised tool to get a better structure.

Except for adopting new equipment, production scheduling could play an important role in reducing the total energy consumption of a manufacturing plant. Machine tools waste a considerable amount of energy because of their underutilization. Consequently, energy saving can be achieved by switching machines to standby or off when they lay idle for a comparatively long period. Herein, we first introduce the objectives of minimizing non-processing energy consumption, total weighted tardiness and earliness, and makespan into a typical production scheduling model-The job shop scheduling problem, based on a machine status switching framework. The multi-objective genetic algorithm U-NSGA-III combined with MME (a heuristic algorithm combined with the MinMax (MM) and Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) algorithms) population initialization method is used to solve the problem. The multi-objective optimization algorithm can generate a Pareto set of solutions so that production managers can flexibly select a schedule from these non-dominated schedules based on their priorities. Three sets of numerical experiments have been carried out on the extended Taillard benchmark to verify this three-objective model's effectiveness and the multi-objective optimization algorithm. The results show that U-NSGA-III has obtained better Pareto solutions in most test problem instances than NSGA-II and NSGA-III. Furthermore, the non-processing energy consumption is reduced by 46%-69%, which is 13-83% of the total energy consumption. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","energy efficiency; Job shop scheduling; machine status switching; unified multi-objective genetic algorithm","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Machine tools; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Production control; Scheduling; Turing machines; Job shop scheduling problems; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Numerical experiments; Population initializations; Production Scheduling; Total energy consumption; Total-weighted tardiness; Traditional manufacturing; Job shop scheduling","","","This work was supported in part by the Science and Technology Innovation 2030–‘‘New Generation of Artificial Intelligence’’ Major Project under Grant 2018AAA0101803, in part by the National Science and Technology Major Project of Guizhou Province under Grant [2019]3003 and Grant [2017]3001, in part by the Science and Technology Project of Guizhou Province under Grant [2015]4011 and Grant [2017]5788, and in part by the Major Platform Project for Integration of Institutions of Higher Learning in Guizhou Province under Grant [2020]005.","Nat Renew Energy Lab Golden Co Usa Tech Rep Nrel Bk 6a20 73901 DOE Go 102020 5178, (2020); Duque, Eliana Torres, Energy Consumption Control of One Machine Manufacturing System with Stochastic Arrivals Based on Fuzzy Logic, IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, 2019-December, pp. 1503-1507, (2018); Feng, Lujia, Energy consumption modeling and analyses in automotive manufacturing final assembly process, pp. 224-228, (2015); Balamurali Gunji, A., An Optimal Robotic Assembly Sequence Planning by Assembly Subsets Detection Method Using Teaching Learning-Based Optimization Algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 15, 3, pp. 1369-1385, (2018); Tian, Guangdong, Disassembly Sequence Planning Considering Fuzzy Component Quality and Varying Operational Cost, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 15, 2, pp. 748-760, (2018); Tian, Guangdong, Modeling and Planning for Dual-Objective Selective Disassembly Using and/or Graph and Discrete Artificial Bee Colony, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 15, 4, pp. 2456-2468, (2019); Liu, Ying, An investigation into minimising total energy consumption and total weighted tardiness in job shops, Journal of Cleaner Production, 65, pp. 87-96, (2014); Piroozfard, Hamed, Minimizing total carbon footprint and total late work criterion in flexible job shop scheduling by using an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 128, pp. 267-283, (2018); Álvarez-Valdés, Ramón, Minimizing weighted earliness-tardiness on parallel machines using hybrid metaheuristics, Computers and Operations Research, 54, pp. 1-11, (2015); Yazdani, M., Optimizing the sum of maximum earliness and tardiness of the job shop scheduling problem, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 107, pp. 12-24, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103905270"

The beetles have many species and many of these are advantageous to the nature as well as the mankind. Excepting the odor sensing activity, the beetles are naturally strong insects, and some of them have storage memory for adaptive learning and showcase social behavior. These natural mechanisms make them intelligent enough to perform the routine tasks for existence. This article proposes a novel Storage (Memory) Adaptive Collaborative BAS (SACBAS) algorithm, which incorporates the memory stored adaptive learning. This helps exploit the Group Extreme Value (GEV) instead of the Individual Extreme Values in swarm for faster convergence. Further, the SACBAS uses the reference points based on non-dominated sorting to diversify the state space. To test the data-driven performance of SACBAS, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with linear kernel is used in this study. First, the SACBAS algorithm is tested on the multi-objective ZDT and DTLZ test-suites and compared with two recent techniques, the reference points based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA III) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). Second, the data-driven SACBAS is tested with real-world cases based on offline data. The proposed SACBAS is shown to handle the offline data efficiently and obtains promising results.

The main objective of the proposed research design is to discover the use of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) for feature selection in digital mammography. The Pareto-optimal fronts generated by MOPSO and NSGA-III for two conflicting objective functions are used to select optimal features. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used to compute the fitness of objective functions. The importance of features selected by MOPSO and NSGA-III are assessed using artificial neural networks. The experimental results show that MOPSO based optimization is superior to NSGA-III. MOPSO achieves high accuracy with a 55% feature reduction.

The present work proposes a new Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) based genetic algorithm (GA) model for a wind energy system. The proposed algorithm consists of non-dominated sorting which focuses to maximize the power extraction of the wind turbine, minimize the cost of generating energy, and the lifetime of the battery. Additionally, the performance characteristics of the wind turbine and battery energy storage system (BESS) are analyzed specifically torque, current, voltage, state of charge (SOC), and internal resistance. The complete analysis is carried out in the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The simulated results are compared with existing optimization techniques such as single-objective, multi-objective, and non-dominating sorting GA II (Genetic Algorithm-II). From the observed results, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA III) optimization algorithm offers superior performance notably higher turbine power output with higher torque rate, lower speed variation, reduced energy cost, and lesser degradation rate of the battery. This result attested to the fact that the proposed optimization tool can extract a higher rate of power from a self-excited induction generator (SEIG) when compared with a conventional optimization tool. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dominating and non-dominated sorting; Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization (MOO); Single-objective optimization; Wind energy system","energy resource; energy storage; genetic algorithm; optimization; performance assessment; power generation; torque; wind power; wind turbine; wind velocity","","","The authors would like to thank the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, College of Engineering, Anna University, Chennai, India, for the technical expertise provided.

Under load rejection conditions, the turbine speed and the flow channel pressure will threaten the unit. By adjusting the wicket gate closing law (WGCL), we can effectively alleviate the adverse effects of the transient process. In this study, a full flow channel refined model of a high-head PSPS was constructed, and the influence mechanism of load rejection conditions on key parameters was analyzed by tracking the operating trajectory on the S characteristic curves and simulating the transient flow field inside the pumped turbine by three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3D-CFD). Given the contradiction between different parameters in the wicket gate closing process, a third-generation non-dominated genetic algorithm based on reference point selection (NSGA-III) was introduced, and a high-dimensional multi-objective WGCL optimization model was constructed. We compared parameter changes in the two-phase and three-phase WGCL optimized elite solutions and explained the rationality of adopting the three-phase WGCL in high-head PSPSs. By proposing an improved three-phase WGCL, a new scheme - the most suitable WGCL under load rejection - was obtained through precise optimization. The research embodied the excellent effect of the heuristic multi-objective (MO) optimization algorithm based on the Pareto strategy in solving the operation problem of the large fluctuation transient process of hydraulic machinery.

To improve the user-friendliness and convenience of online platforms, the personalized service recommendation for different customer requirement is an effective means. However, since manufacturing services usually appear in the form of composite services, existing Web service-based personalized recommendation technologies are difficult to be applied effectively. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm to address the personalized recommendation for manufacturing service composition (MSC). The algorithm solves the insufficient individualization defect of MSC optimization by comprehensively considering the QoS objective attributes and customer preference attributes. First, a Clustering-based Collaborative Filtering (CCF) algorithm is proposed to quantify the customer preference attributes. Second, an improved Personalization-oriented third generation Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (PoNSGA-III) is presented for the multi-attribute MSC optimization. Finally, the hybrid algorithm recommends the most suitable solutions for the target customer through the ranking of customer preference attributes.

The modeling and optimal planning of the WF is preliminary before its construction. In this article, a bi-level multi-objective optimization framework is presented, with the aim of simultaneously designing the configuration of wind turbines (WTs) as well as the topology of electrical collector system in an offshore WF. The installation capacity of the WF, the positioning of the WTs and the planning scheme of the electrical systemare balanced to achieve a better performance of the WF. In this proposal, there is an outer layer along with two inner layers. The objectives of the outer-layer model are the maximization of the WF's daily profit rate, the daily average capacity factor, and power quality. It is tackled by the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III). The objectives of the two inner layer models are to determine the topology of the electrical system and the generation schedule of other generators, and are solved by means of the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm and the quadratic programming (QP) method respectively. The WF is assumed to be connected to the IEEE-24 bus test system. The simulation results validate the adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed approach with the main factors that affect the WF layout being analyzed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bi-level programming; Multi-objective optimization; optimal cabling; wind turbine micro-siting","Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind turbines; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quadratic programming; Topology; Average capacities; Binary particle swarm optimization; Electrical systems; Generation schedules; Installation capacities; Joint optimization; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Wind turbine micrositing; Offshore wind farms","","","Manuscript received February 4, 2020; revised May 4, 2020 and July 28, 2020; accepted September 3, 2020.

It seems to be a very valuable tool in the future. However, the optimal deployment of a set of monitoring drones is a very challenging problem; it is a NP-Hard problem. In this paper, the deployment problem has been modelled as a constrained many-objective optimisation problem. Powerful heuristics, namely multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC), multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II), strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEA II) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA III) are used to find the optimal deployment strategy with four goals: minimising energy consumption, maximising total coverage, maintaining connectivity and minimising overlaps. A comparative study was carried out and the results showed that the SPEA II, NSGA III and NSGA II algorithms have better convergence and maintain good diversity than the other algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coverage problem; Drones deployment; Many-objective optimisation; Pareto front; UAV; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Constrained optimization; Drones; Energy utilization; Multiobjective optimization; NP-hard; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Screening; Comparative studies; Deployment problems; Multi-objective artificial bee colonies; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective optimisation; Particle swarm optimisation; Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm; Genetic algorithms","","","","Abdelhafidh, Maroua, Wireless sensor network monitoring system: Architecture, applications and future directions, International Journal of Communication Networks and Distributed Systems, 23, 4, pp. 413-451, (2019); Alsalam, Bilal, Autonomous UAV with vision based on-board decision making for remote sensing and precision agriculture, IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, (2017); Alzenad, Mohamed, 3-D Placement of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Station for Maximum Coverage of Users with Different QoS Requirements, IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 7, 1, pp. 38-41, (2018); Alzenad, Mohamed, 3-D Placement of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Station (UAV-BS) for Energy-Efficient Maximal Coverage, IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 6, 4, pp. 434-437, (2017); Ammad-Udin, Muhammad, UAV routing protocol for crop health management, European Signal Processing Conference, 2016-November, pp. 1818-1822, (2016); Recent Advances in Evolutionary Multi Objective Optimization, (2016); Caillouet, Christelle, Efficient deployment of connected unmanned aerial vehicles for optimal target coverage, 2017-December, pp. 1-8, (2017); Chand, Shelvin, Evolutionary many-objective optimization: A quick-start guide, Surveys in Operations Research and Management Science, 20, 2, pp. 35-42, (2015); Coello, Carlos A., MOPSO: A proposal for multiple objective particle swarm optimization, 2, pp. 1051-1056, (2002); da Costa, Fausto Guzzo, The use of unmanned aerial vehicles and wireless sensor network in agricultural applications, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), pp. 5045-5048, (2012)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","17543916; 17543924","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097574487"

A Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROV) used in the tank cleaning operation however, suffers from a high operational cost due to the lack of systematic operator guidance in robot maneuvering. This paper presents a multi-objective approach in designing a Decision Support System (DSS) for underwater cleaning robot. To explore all feasible path, the path alternatives for every cleaning point in the tank is found using Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM). Then, an optimized sequential route are identified using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm using Reference Point Based (NSGA-III). Several objectives such as path length and routing angle are considered to be optimized, while ensuring constraints such as similar deployment point, maximum daily time limit and cable entanglement. To measure the quality of the proposed solution, comparisons have been done based on performance of NSGA-III with Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) by considering the C-Metric value, execution time and estimated cleaning duration. In addition, comparisons with conventional path by human operator is also conducted to validate the significance of DSS application in underwater tank cleaning. Results have shown that NSGA-III has superiorities with an improvement of 11.11% in cleaning time as compared to NSGA-II and 5.12% improvement compared to MOPSO. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-objective; Navigation; Tank cleaning; Underwater robot; Water reservoir","Agricultural robots; Decision support systems; Genetic algorithms; Maneuverability; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Remotely operated underwater vehicles; Remotely operated vehicles; Reservoirs (water); Robot programming; Robots; Screening; Tanks (containers); Water supply; Decision support system (dss); Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Operator guidance; Probabilistic roadmap; Reference points; Water supply operations; Cleaning","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), for their partial financial support through their research funds, Vote No. R.J130000.7851.4L710, Q.J130000.2651.17J53 and R.J130000.7351.4B428.; Funding text 2: The authors are grateful to the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), for their partial financial support through their research funds, Vote No. R.J130000.7851.4L710, Q.J130000.2651.17J53 and R.J130000.7351.4B428.","Enevoldsen, Thomas Thuesen, Simplified Modelling and Identification of an Inspection ROV, 51, 8, pp. 257-262, (2018); Lee, Manhyung, Hydrodynamic design of an underwater hull cleaning robot and its evaluation, International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, 4, 4, pp. 335-352, (2012); Rov Auv Trends Market and Technology, (2012); Hosseini, Meshkat, Robust ROV path following considering disturbance and measurement error using data fusion, Applied Ocean Research, 54, pp. 67-72, (2016); Li, Baotong, Topology optimization techniques for mobile robot path planning, Applied Soft Computing, 78, pp. 528-544, (2019); Cowlagi, Raghvendra V., Multiresolution motion planning for autonomous agents via wavelet-based cell decompositions, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42, 5, pp. 1455-1469, (2012); Marble, James D., Asymptotically near-optimal planning with probabilistic roadmap spanners, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 29, 2, pp. 432-444, (2013); Kaluder, Hrvoje, A visibility graph based method for path planning in dynamic environments, pp. 717-721, (2011); Niu, Hanlin, An energy-efficient path planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles, Ocean Engineering, 161, pp. 308-321, (2018); Quarterly of Applied Mathematics, (1958)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","09210296; 15730409","","JIRSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097507737"

By varying the hydrogen (H<inf>2</inf>) flow rate, CH<inf>4</inf>-Argon (Ar) flow rate and deposition temperature (Td) as per a Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD), 15 DLC deposition experiments are carried out. The Young's modulus (E) and the coefficient of friction (COF) for the DLCs are measured. By using a second-order polynomial regression approach, two metamodels are built for E and COF, that establish them as functions of H<inf>2</inf>flow rate, CH<inf>4</inf>-Ar flow rate and T<inf>d</inf>. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) is used to obtain a set of Pareto solutions for the multi-objective optimization of E maximization and COF minimization. According to various practical scenarios, evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) approach is used to identify the most feasible solutions out of the Pareto solution set. Confirmation experiments are conducted which shows the efficacy of the polynomial regression - NSGA-III - EDAS hybrid approach.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is an important technology that can mitigate both inner and outer threats for the vulnerable networks like VANETs. However, it is difficult to adopt the same IDSs that have been appropriately used in wired networks, due to the fast moving and highly dynamic nature of VANETs. Thus, in this article, an Efficient and Collaborative Framework with a Markov-based Reputation Scheme is proposed, namely ECF-MRS. In the proposed framework, the collaborative mechanism is achieved by using Non-dominant Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III)-Collaboration to merge the advantages of IDSs in VANETs to generate a more superior IDS, while Non-Linear Programming (NLP)-Optimization is designed as the efficient mechanism to reduce the execution time of IDSs in VANETs. Moreover, considering the security risks of collaboration, a Reputation Scheme based on the Hidden Generalized Mixture Transition Distribution (HgMTD) model, namely RS-HgMTD, is proposed for each vehicle in VANETs to evaluate the creditworthiness of their neighbors. Experiments show that the IDS with ECF-MRS has better performance than other existing IDSs in terms of detection rate, detection time and overhead. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","HgMTD model; IDSs; NLP-Optimization; NSGA-III-Collaboration; VANETs","Genetic algorithms; Intrusion detection; Nonlinear programming; Collaborative framework; Detection rates; Generalized mixtures; Intrusion Detection Systems; Reputation schemes; Sorting genetic algorithm; Vehicle ad-hoc networks; Vehicular networks; Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","Funding text 1: Manuscript received December 3, 2019; revised April 30, 2020; accepted July 25, 2020.

However, algorithm requires field-expert intervention with huge database of training samples to evaluate its clustering performance. Moreover, lacking in availability of labelled data makes difficult to train the input samples. Therefore, this article puts forward unsupervised many-objective evolutionary clustering technique to discriminate cloudy regions on varying characteristic of underlying surfaces. The study begins with the modification in search capability of θ-NSGA-III optimisation algorithm by incorporating penalised vector angle concept in associate operator. The analysis of proposed approach has been carried out on benchmark many-objective DTLZ test problems, compared against original θ-NSGA-III and NSGA-III algorithms. The proposed modified θ-NSGA-III has been further utilised as clustering technique to solve unsupervised cloud detection problem. Optimal centroid vector for clustering using proposed approach is obtained through modified crossover operator, mutation operator and environmental selection method. Experimental results reveal that proposed approach outperforms comparative many-objective algorithms, MOEA/D and NSGA-III for Landsat 8, MODIS and NOAA satellite images with lower classification average error of 2.44% in cloud detection for most of the evaluated test cases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Image enhancement; Satellite imagery; Automatic cloud detection; Clustering techniques; Evolutionary clustering; Mutation operators; Search capabilities; Supervised learning approaches; Underlying surface; Weather information; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","Li, Zhengqiang, Remote sensing of atmospheric particulate mass of dry PM2.5 near the ground: Method validation using ground-based measurements, Remote Sensing of Environment, 173, pp. 59-68, (2016); Fenta, Ayele Almaw, The dynamics of urban expansion and land use/land cover changes using remote sensing and spatial metrics: The case of Mekelle city of northern Ethiopia, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 38, 14, pp. 4107-4129, (2017); Magney, Troy S., Response of high frequency Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) measurements to environmental conditions in wheat, Remote Sensing of Environment, 173, pp. 84-97, (2016); Tapakis, Rogiros, Equipment and methodologies for cloud detection and classification: A review, Solar Energy, 95, pp. 392-430, (2013); Yang, Fan, Automated extraction of urban water bodies from ZY-3 multi-spectral imagery, Water (Switzerland), 9, 2, (2017); Zhang, Yanan, DEM extraction and accuracy assessment based on ZY-3 stereo images, pp. 1439-1442, (2012); Guo, Jianhua, Image matching using structural similarity and geometric constraint approaches on remote sensing images, Journal of Applied Remote Sensing, 10, 4, (2016); Minnis, Patrick, Diurnal variability of regional cloud and clear-sky radiative parameters derived from GOES data.

The purpose of multi-objective virtual machine placement (MO-VMP) is to find the best place of VMs on physical machines (PMs) so as to reach predetermined goals. In this regard, a fundamental goal is maximizing the utilization of available resources while minimizing energy consumption. It is clear that inefficient use of computing resources (for instance CPU, memory, storage capacity, and bandwidth) could cause increased energy wastage. On the other hand, with optimal placement of VMs on PMs, one may prevent migrating them from one PM to another in the future, itself a secondary cause of increased energy consumption. Concerning the MO-VMP, there are very serious challenges in previous studies. Some of these works have attempted to minimize the number of active PMs. Others have investigated minimizing rack link traffic and optimizing communication and VM migration costs regarding routing goals. Since the MO-VMP is an NP-hard problem and involves high spatial and temporal complexities, heuristic and meta-heuristic methods have been widely used to solve the problem in the past decade. In the present research, we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to determine the optimal MO-VMP. To this end, a multi-objective optimizing problem is designed, and after introducing a non-linear convex optimization solution, we solve it with the NSGA-III method. Our main purpose is to minimize overall resource loss while minimizing power consumption as well as decreasing the number of active PMs. The simulation results on the CloudSim simulator confirm the superiority of the proposed method over basic methods such as first-fit decreasing (FFD) and exact mathematical approaches in terms of significant criteria such as execution time, utilization, resource wastage, and energy consumption. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy consumption; Meta-heuristic method; Multi-objective optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III); Virtual machine placement (VMP)","Cloud computing; Convex optimization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Network security; NP-hard; Virtual machine; Computing resource; Mathematical approach; Meta-heuristic approach; Meta-heuristic methods; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimal placements; Optimization solution; Virtual machine placements; Heuristic methods","","","","Kaur, Avinash, Data placement in era of cloud computing: A survey, taxonomy and open research issues, Scalable Computing, 20, 2, pp. 377-398, (2019); Wu, Yu, Green Data Center Placement in Optical Cloud Networks, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 1, 3, pp. 347-357, (2017); Wei, Wenting, Energy Efficient Virtual Machine Placement with an Improved Ant Colony Optimization over Data Center Networks, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 60617-60625, (2019); Hejja, Khaled, Offline and online power aware resource allocation algorithms with migration and delay constraints, Computer Networks, 158, pp. 17-34, (2019); Luo, Juan, Reliable Virtual Machine Placement Based on Multi-Objective Optimization with Traffic-Aware Algorithm in Industrial Cloud, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 23043-23052, (2018); Zheng, Qinghua, Virtual machine consolidated placement based on multi-objective biogeography-based optimization, Future Generation Computer Systems, 54, pp. 95-122, (2016); Mohammadi, Alireza, A novel optimized approach for resource reservation in cloud computing using producer–consumer theory of microeconomics, Journal of Supercomputing, 75, 11, pp. 7391-7425, (2019); Tavakoli-Someh, Sanaz, Multi-objective virtual network function placement using NSGA-II meta-heuristic approach, Journal of Supercomputing, 75, 10, pp. 6451-6487, (2019); Liu, Xiaofang, An Energy Efficient Ant Colony System for Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 22, 1, pp. 113-128, (2018); Sun, Gang, Energy-efficient and traffic-aware service function chaining orchestration in multi-domain networks, Future Generation Computer Systems, 91, pp. 347-360, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","13867857","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094152690"

Parameters such as the average duration and cost of the simulation output are used to evaluate the fitness of individuals, and consequently, the development process is optimized using the NSGA-III algorithm. By comparing the optimization results of the development task process under different quantities of resources, the impact of the quantity of resources on the optimization results of the development task process is analyzed. With a view to obtain a more satisfactory development task process, the PSO algorithm is nested into NSGA-III. The Pareto front solution set is obtained from the optimization of the task process. The PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the resource allocation for the development task process. Joint optimization of the high-end equipment development task process and resource allocation is carried out.

As multi-label classification tasks appear in various fields, researchers have investigated multi-label feature selection algorithms to reduce data dimensions. Most of the existing wrapper multi-label feature selection algorithms use multi-objective method to obtain the selected features. However, there are multiple criteria to measure the quality of multi-label classification results. In view of this, this study presents a many-objective optimization based multi-label feature selection algorithm (MMFS). To improve the diversity and convergence of NSGA III, we propose an improved NSGA III algorithm with two archives. In this algorithm, new crossover and mutation operators for feature selection are designed to improve the exploration capability, and the influence of the selection threshold θ on feature scale and multi-label classification performance in real number coding is studied. Finally, we conduct experiments on 11 multi-label datasets. The experiments demonstrate that MMFS can balance multiple objectives, remove irrelevant and redundant features, and obtain satisfactory classification results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature selection; Machine learning; Many-objective optimization; Multi-label classification","Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Classification results; Crossover and mutation; Feature selection algorithm; Many-objective optimizations; Multi label classification; Multiple-objectives; Real number coding; Redundant features; Classification (of information)","","","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 61472095 ), Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province ( JJ2020LH1342 ), Preparatory Research Foundation of Education Department of Heilongjiang ( 1354MSYYB003 ) and Research Foundation of Mudanjiang Normal University ( YB2020010 ).","Zhang, Minling, ML-KNN: A lazy learning approach to multi-label learning, Pattern Recognition, 40, 7, pp. 2038-2048, (2007); Liu, Meng, Low-rank multi-view learning in matrix completion for multi-label image classification, Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 4, pp. 2778-2784, (2015); Bravo-Marquez, Felipe, Determining Word-Emotion Associations from Tweets by Multi-label Classification, pp. 536-539, (2017); de Almeida, Alex Marino Gonçalves, Applying multi-label techniques in emotion identification of short texts, Neurocomputing, 320, pp. 35-46, (2018); Lee, Jaesung, Memetic feature selection for multilabel text categorization using label frequency difference, Information Sciences, 485, pp. 263-280, (2019); Al-Salemi, Bassam, RFBoost: An improved multi-label boosting algorithm and its application to text categorisation, Knowledge-Based Systems, 103, pp. 104-117, (2016); Wang, Bin, Deep multi-task learning for air quality prediction, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11305 LNCS, pp. 93-103, (2018); Lerman, Liran, Template attacks vs. Machine learning revisited (and the curse of dimensionality in side-channel analysis), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9064, pp. 20-33, (2015); Li, Yun, Recent advances in feature selection and its applications, Knowledge and Information Systems, 53, 3, pp. 551-577, (2017); Kashef, Shima, A label-specific multi-label feature selection algorithm based on the Pareto dominance concept, Pattern Recognition, 88, pp. 654-667, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091511445"

In this paper, a hybrid learning framework is developed to forecast multi-step-ahead (one, two, and three-month-ahead) meningitis cases in four states of Brazil. First, the proposed approach applies an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to decompose the data into intrinsic mode functions and residual components. Then, each component is used as the input of five different forecasting models, and, from there, forecasted results are obtained. Finally, all combinations of models and components are developed, and for each case, the forecasted results are weighted integrated (WI) to formulate a heterogeneous ensemble forecaster for the monthly meningitis cases. In the final stage, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm – version II is employed to find a set of candidates’ weights, and then the Technique for Order of Preference by similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to choose the adequate set of weights. Next, the most adequate model is the one with the best generalization capacity out-of-sample in terms of performance criteria including mean absolute error (MAE), relative root mean squared error (RRMSE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE). By using MOO, the intention is to enhance the performance of the forecasting models by improving simultaneously their accuracy and stability measures. To access the model's performance, comparisons based on metrics are conducted with: (i) EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble integrated by direct strategy, or simple sum; (ii) EEMD, homogeneous ensemble of components WI; (iii) models without signal decomposition. At this stage, MAE, RRMSE, and sMAPE criteria as well as Diebold–Mariano statistical test are adopted. In all twelve scenarios, the proposed framework was able to perform more accurate and stable forecasts, which showed, on 89.17% of the cases, that the errors of the proposed approach are statistically lower than other approaches. These results showed that combining EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble and WI with weights obtained by optimization can develop precise and stable forecasts.

We developed TOPTWR, an extension of the popular TOPTW model, to model the issues in task allocation for teams of rescue robots. Our hybrid algorithm is based on a team of heterogeneous humanoid robots trying to optimize five objectives (task rewards, task completion time, total energy, maximum energy consumption for a single robot, and missed deadline penalties). A common approach to solve these kinds of problems are multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), but their major disadvantage is that they cannot deal with dynamic environments easily. This paper presents an efficient solution for TOPTWR by combining MOEAs with learning algorithms. A novel Extended Multi-Start Simulated Annealing Iterated Local Search (EMSAILS) operator using a modern state-of-the-art NSGA-III algorithm is proposed. In addition, we applied Q-Learning to learn the likely changes in the environment and how to react to them. This algorithm, HMO-TOPTWR-NSGA-III (HMO-N-L), uses an artificial neural network (ANN) as a function approximator to make the huge state and action spaces tractable. This paper includes a thorough empirical evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-objective algorithm in both static and dynamic environments. The evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm reduces the error by up to 42% against three state-of-the-art approaches to TOPTW (HMO-N, MSA, and IPI). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Humanoid robots; Multi-objective optimization; Q-learning; Rescue applications; Team Orienteering Problem","Anthropomorphic robots; Disasters; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Losses; Reinforcement learning; Simulated annealing; Social robots; Empirical evaluations; Function approximators; Iterated local search; Multi objective algorithm; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; State-of-the-art approach; Static and dynamic environments; Team orienteering problems; Learning algorithms","","","This work was financially supported by the “Chinese Language and Technology Center” of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan, and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grants No. MOST 108-2634-F-003-002 , MOST 108-2634-F-003-003 , and MOST 108-2634-F-003-004 (administered through Pervasive Artificial Intelligence Research (PAIR) Labs), as well as MOST 107-2811-E-003-503 .

It is pertinent to improve the robustness of ATNs as they are frequently exposed to manifold uncertainties which can break down their functioning components. Existing studies improve the robustness of an ATN by either rewiring its links or adding more ones. In this paper we discover the robustness paradox phenomenon in ATNs. Specifically, we claim to improve the robustness of an ATN by removing its links. In order to determine the links whose removal can improve an ATN's robustness, we develop a bi-objective optimization model with one objective maximizing the network's robustness and the other one minimizing the number of links to be removed. We further apply and modify a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize the developed model. We then carry out experiments on nine real-world ATNs to validate the effectiveness of the proposed idea. We also compare the modified NSGA-II algorithm against NSGA-III, and MODPSO, which are famous and efficient multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Experiments indicate that NSGA-II outperforms the compared algorithms and that robustness paradox phenomenon does exist in ATNs.

When the least present value of revenue (LPVR) mechanism is adopted in the competitive procurement of PPPs, the MOP presents asymmetry in objective levels, control variables and action orders. This paper characterizes this asymmetrical MOP in Stackelberg theory and builds a bi-level programing model to solve it in order to support the decision-making activities of both the public and private sectors in negotiation. An intuitive algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA III) framework is designed to generate Pareto solutions that allow decision-makers to choose optimal strategies from their own criteria. The effectiveness of the model and algorithm is validated via a real case of a highway PPP project. The results reveal that the PPP project will be financially infeasible without the transfer of certain amounts of exterior benefits into supplementary income for the private sector. Besides, the strategy of transferring minimum exterior benefits is more beneficial to the public sector than to users. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bi-level programing; Least present value of revenue (LPVR); Multi-objective optimization problem (MOP); Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGAIII); Public-private partnerships (PPP); Stackelberg game","","","","","Wang, Huanming, Public–private partnership in Public Administration discipline: a literature review, Public Management Review, 20, 2, pp. 293-316, (2018); Koppenjan, Joop F.M., The formation of public-private partnerships: Lessons from nine transport infrastructure projects in the Netherlands, Public Administration, 83, 1, pp. 135-157, (2005); Papajohn, Dean, Public-private partnerships in U.S. transportation: Research overview and a path forward, Journal of Management in Engineering, 27, 3, pp. 126-135, (2011); Garvin, Michael J., Enabling development of the transportation public-private partnership market in the United States, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 136, 4, pp. 402-411, (2010); Xu, Yelin, Determining appropriate government guarantees for concession contract: lessons learned from 10 PPP projects in China, International Journal of Strategic Property Management, 18, 4, pp. 356-367, (2014); Kayhan, İlker Ersegün, Determination of socially equitable guarantees for public–private partnerships: a toll-road case from Turkey, Turkish Studies, 17, 4, pp. 691-711, (2016); Rouhani, Omid M., Policy lessons for regulating public-private partnership tolling schemes in urban environments, Transport Policy, 41, pp. 68-79, (2015); Song, Jinbo, Pareto optimization of public-private partnership toll road contracts with government guarantees, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 117, pp. 158-175, (2018); Button, Kenneth John, Sharing out the costs of a public-private partnership, Applied Economics Letters, 21, 6, pp. 383-386, (2014); Vassallo, José Manuel, The role of the discount rate in tendering highway concessions under the LPVR approach, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 44, 10, pp. 806-814, (2010)","","MDPI AG diversity@mdpi.com","","","","","","20738994","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093657940"

These difficulties may concern the exponential execution time, the effectiveness of the mutation and recombination operators or finding the tradeoff between diversity and convergence. In this paper, the issue of 3D redeploying in indoor the connected objects (or nodes) in the Internet of Things collection networks (formerly known as wireless sensor nodes) is investigated. The aim is to determine the ideal locations of the objects to be added to enhance an initial deployment while satisfying antagonist objectives and constraints. In this regard, a first proposed contribution aim to introduce an hybrid model that includes many-objective optimization algorithms relying on decomposition (MOEA/D, MOEA/DD) and reference points (Two_Arch2, NSGA-III) while using two strategies for introducing the preferences (PI-EMO-PC) and the dimensionality reduction (MVU-PCA). This hybridization aims to combine the algorithms advantages for resolving the many-objective issues. The second contribution concerns prototyping and deploying real connected objects which allows assessing the performance of the proposed hybrid scheme on a real world environment.

In this article, to expand the capacity of blockchain, for each peer, we select old blocks which are created previously and less likely to be queried and store them in the cloud. Based on this idea, we develop objective functions related to query probability, storage cost, and local space occupancy, which naturally narrows down the problem to block selection. The results can be obtained by solving a multiobjective optimization problem. We design a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with clustering (NSGA-C), which changes the method of selecting individuals from the critical dominance layer by adding clustering to ensure diversity. A suitable solution can be selected from the Pareto set to fulfil the requirements of different users. We then compare the algorithm with the improved NSGA-II and NSGA-III, which both add integer constraints to the decision variables. The results show that our method is better than NSGA-II and NSGA-III in terms of local space occupancy in the blockchain application. In addition, it can also effectively avoid the risk of block overflow. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blockchain; cloud storage; Internet of Things (IoT); multiobjective optimization; scalability; storage capacity","Blockchain; Digital storage; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Multiobjective optimization; Decision variables; Improved NSGA-II; Integer constraints; Internet of thing (IOT); Multi-objective optimization problem; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective functions; Suitable solutions; Clustering algorithms","","","Manuscript received December 16, 2019; revised March 1, 2020 and April 10, 2020; accepted April 26, 2020.

For scheduling such a system, initially the discrete tasks to be performed during the scheduling horizon is unknown such that heuristics and meta-heuristics are not directly applicable, which further complicates its scheduling problem. Moreover, there are large number of objectives to be optimized, including the minimization of energy consumption due to that crude oil operations consume large amount of energy and therefore lead to large amount of emissions. Furthermore, the energy optimization problem is characterized as highly non-linearity. Hence, the scheduling problem of crude oil operations in refineries belongs to the many-objective optimization problems and it is extremely challenging. This paper addresses this challenging scheduling problem of crude oil operations. This scheduling problem is first converted to a discrete dynamic resource allocation problem such that meta-heuristics can be applicable. Then, with the results of large number of experiments, this work innovatively proposes an NSGA-Ⅲ-based optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the problem for Pareto-optimal solutions. By the proposed method, the genes in a chromosome are generated one by one and, when generating a gene, safeness check is done according to the derived safeness conditions such that each gene is feasible. In this way, the schedule feasibility can be ensured. An industrial case study is given to test its performance and comparison is made with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms for many-objective optimization problems. The results show its good performance in terms of convergence, solution diversity, time efficiency, and its applicability to real-life refinery scheduling problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crude oil operations; Energy efficiency; NSGA-Ⅲ; Pareto-optimality; Scheduling","Crude oil; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genes; Hybrid systems; Pareto principle; Crude oil operations; Energy optimization; Industrial case study; Many-objective optimizations; Optimization algorithms; Pareto optimal solutions; Refinery scheduling; State-of-the-art algorithms; Scheduling","","","Funding text 1: This work was funded in part by the Science and Technology development fund (FDCT), Macau SAR (File nos. 0017/2019/A1 and 0012/2019/A1), and in part by the National Natural Foundation of China under Grant 61603100, and the Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province under grant 2020B010166006.; Funding text 2: This work was funded in part by the Science and Technology development fund ( FDCT ), Macau SAR (File nos. 0017/2019/A1 and 0012/2019/A1 ), and in part by the National Natural Foundation of China under Grant 61603100 , and the Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province under grant 2020B010166006 .","Lautenschläger Moro, Lincoln Fernando L., Process technology in the petroleum refining industry - Current situation and future trends, Computers and Chemical Engineering, 27, 8-9, pp. 1303-1305, (2003); Rpms Refinery and Petrochemical Modeling System A System Description, (1979); Pims System Reference, (1999); Proceeding of 1996 National Petroleum Refiners Association Annual Meeting San Antonio TX Usa March 17 19, (1996); Honkomp, S.

This requires a multi-objective optimization approach for forcefield parameterization. Existing methodologies for forcefield parameterization use ad-hoc and empirical weighting schemes to convert this into a single-objective optimization problem. Here, we provide and describe software to perform multi-objective optimization of Stillinger–Weber forcefields (SWFF) for two-dimensional layered materials using the recently developed 3rd generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). NSGA-III converges to the set of optimal forcefields lying on the Pareto front in the multi-dimensional objective space. This set of forcefields is used for uncertainty quantification of computed thermal conductivity due to variability in the forcefield parameters. We demonstrate this new optimization scheme by constructing a SWFF for a representative two-dimensional material, 2H-MoSe<inf>2</inf> and quantifying the uncertainty in their computed thermal conductivity. Program summary: Program Title: MOGA-NSGA3 Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/pbc6nb7hp9.1 Licensing Provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming Language: C++ Nature of problem: Interatomic forcefields used for molecular dynamics simulations of thermal conductivity must be parameterized to accurately capture structural and vibrational properties of the material system being modeled. Therefore, these forcefields must be simultaneously optimized against several (n ≥ 5) material properties. However, such parameterization is difficult using existing forcefield parameterization schemes, which are limited to optimization of a single or few (n < 3) objectives. Solution method: We present software to perform evolutionary optimization of forcefields for thermal conductivity simulations using the recently developed 3rd generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). The algorithm's unique reference-point-based niching and non-dominated sorting schemes enable efficient exploration of higher-dimensional objective spaces while preserving diversity among forcefield populations. The best set of forcefields on the Pareto front are used for estimating uncertainty in computed thermal conductivity due to forcefield parameterization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forcefield parameterization; Genetic algorithm; Molecular dynamics; Multi-objective optimization; Thermal conductivity","C++ (programming language); Genetic algorithms; Lattice constants; Molecular dynamics; Molybdenum compounds; Multiobjective optimization; Open source software; Parameterization; Problem oriented languages; Selenium compounds; Specific heat; Uncertainty analysis; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Evolutionary optimizations; Force-field parameterization; GNU general public license; Molecular dynamics simulations; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Single objective optimization problems; Uncertainty quantifications; Thermal conductivity","","","This work was supported as part of the Computational Materials Sciences Program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy , Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, under Award Number DE-SC0014607 .","Lin, Shangchao, Thermal transport in monolayer graphene oxide: Atomistic insights into phonon engineering through surface chemistry, Carbon, 77, pp. 351-359, (2014); Liang, Tao, Reactive potentials for advanced atomistic simulations, Annual Review of Materials Research, 43, pp. 109-129, (2013); Mishra, Ankit, Multiobjective genetic training and uncertainty quantification of reactive force fields, npj Computational Materials, 4, 1, (2018); Jaramillo-Botero, Andrés, General multiobjective force field optimization framework, with application to reactive force fields for silicon carbide, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 10, 4, pp. 1426-1439, (2014); Larentzos, James P., Parameterizing complex reactive force fields using multiple objective evolutionary strategies (MOES).

This is the first time that a preference-based multi-objective algorithm has been used to address the SCOS problem. In this paper, a novel K-layer preference reference point set approach is proposed for generating a reference point set with this algorithm to guide the search towards the interesting parts of the Pareto optimal region based on customer preferences, which improves the efficiency of the algorithm and the convergence of the obtained solution. A new fitness assignment strategy and environment selection scheme is developed accordingly to balance the relationship of diversity and convergence of preserved individuals in each generation. Additionally, the memetic algorithm is integrated into the evolutionary mechanism of the algorithm to address the insufficiency of local search. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several test cases are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more competitive than other considered algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud manufacturing (CMfg); non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III); preference-based multi-objective algorithm; quality of service (QoS); service composition and optimal selection (SCOS)","Computer aided manufacturing; Economic and social effects; Geometry; Manufacture; Pareto principle; Quality of service; Cloud Manufacturing; Cloud manufacturing (CMfg); Customer preferences; Environment selection; Evolutionary mechanisms; Multi objective algorithm; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Service compositions; Genetic algorithms","","","This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project of China under Grant [number 2018ZX04002001-009].","Cao, Yang, A TQCS-based service selection and scheduling strategy in cloud manufacturing, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 82, 1-4, pp. 235-251, (2016); Chen, Fuzan, A flexible QoS-aware Web service composition method by multi-objective optimization in cloud manufacturing, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 99, pp. 423-431, (2016); Chen, Shengkai, A reinforcement learning based approach for multi-projects scheduling in cloud manufacturing, International Journal of Production Research, 57, 10, pp. 3080-3098, (2019); Cheng, Qian, ANSGA-III: A Multiobjective Endmember Extraction Algorithm for Hyperspectral Images, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 12, 2, pp. 700-721, (2019); Coello, Carlos A., MOPSO: A proposal for multiple objective particle swarm optimization, 2, pp. 1051-1056, (2002); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Du, Yi, Multi-objective scheduling of cloud manufacturing resources through the integration of Cat swarm optimization and Firefly algorithm, Advances in Production Engineering and Management, 14, 3, pp. 333-342, (2019); Fazeli, Mohammad Moein, An ensemble optimisation approach to service composition in cloud manufacturing, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 32, 1, pp. 83-91, (2019); Han, Woogyu, Determination of possible configurations for Li0.5CoO2 delithiated Li-ion battery cathodes: Via DFT calculations coupled with a multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III), Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 20, 41, pp. 26405-26413, (2018)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","0951192X; 13623052","","ICIME","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091753346"

In recent years, Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) approach has gained unprecedented growth for solving software remodularization problem. Most of the previous studies remodularize the software system by optimizing the structural coupling and cohesion metrics as objective functions. These metrics are defined in terms of the number of structural relationships counts, rather than taking patterns of relationships. It has been observed that the computation of coupling and cohesion based on patterns of relationships (i.e., information-theory based) are more accurate than the number of relationships. This paper proposes an information-theoretic software remodularization where an entropy-based similarity measure is introduced as an objective function along with other objective functions i.e., inter-module class change coupling, intra-module class change coupling, module size index (MSI), and module count index (MCI) and is further optimized using many-objective meta-heuristic algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, seven object-oriented software systems have been remodularized using NSGA-III, MOEA/D, IBEA, and TAA algorithms. The results are compared with existing multi-objective formulation of remodularization problem in terms of authoritative software remodularization, non-extreme distribution, and stability. The experimentation results suggest that the proposed approach can be a good alternative to improve the quality of software systems. The findings suggest that the approach is more suitable for generating remodularization solution good from both quality metrics and developers perspective. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information theoretic technique; Search- based software engineering; Software entropy; Software remodularization","Computation theory; Entropy; Heuristic algorithms; Information theory; Optimization; Search engines; Information theoretic techniques; Meta heuristic algorithm; Multi-objective formulation; Object-oriented software systems; Remodularization; Search based software engineering (SBSE); Search-based software engineering; Software entropies; Object oriented programming","","","","Abdeen, Hani, Automatic package coupling and cycle minimization, Proceedings - Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, WCRE, pp. 103-112, (2009); Proceedings of the 10th Wseas International Conference on Communications Electrical Computer Engineering World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society Wseas, (2011); Andritsos, Periklis, Information-theoretic software clustering, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 31, 2, pp. 150-165, (2005); Anquetil, Nicolas, Experiments with clustering as a software remodularization method, Reverse Engineering - Working Conference Proceedings, pp. 235-255, (1999); Arcuri, Andrea, A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1-10, (2011); Barros, Márcio O., An analysis of the effects of composite objectives in multiobjective software module clustering, pp. 1205-1212, (2012); Bavota, Gabriele, Software re-modularization based on structural and semantic metrics, Proceedings - Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, WCRE, pp. 195-204, (2010); Bavota, Gabriele, Using structural and semantic measures to improve software modularization, Empirical Software Engineering, 18, 5, pp. 901-932, (2013); Bavota, Gabriele, An empirical study on the developers' perception of software coupling, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 692-701, (2013); Bavota, Gabriele, Improving software modularization via automated analysis of latent topics and dependencies, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 23, 1, (2014)","","Springer","","","","","","13873326; 15729419","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060690461"

For the sake of alleviating the clashes between the capability constraint of cloudlets and the needs of mobile devices (MDs) for reducing executing latency as well as decreasing the power consumption of MDs, a user-oriented use case in the MEC named computation offloading is taken into consideration. Computation offloading is capable of effectively making the MEC adapt to the resources of cloudlets and MDs in different environments, and it is very beneficial to the development of the internet of things. Owing to the finite computation capabilities of the MDs and the resources of cloudlets are heterogeneous and limited; a three-objective model is established to optimise the time consumption, and the energy consumption of MDs as well as the load balancing of cloudlets jointly. Technically, the authors propose an effective multi-user multi-application computation offloading method in the multi-cloudlet environment on the basis of improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III.

However, ECDs are often overloaded or underloaded with disproportionate resource requests. In addition, during the process of task offloading, the transmitted information is vulnerable, which can result in data incompleteness. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-enabled computation offloading method, named BeCome, is proposed in this article. Blockchain technology is employed in edge computing to ensure data integrity. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to generate strategies for balanced resource allocation. Furthermore, simple additive weighting and multicriteria decision making are utilized to identify the optimal offloading strategy.

However, most evolutionary algorithms only focus on solving small-scale multi/many-objective optimization problems, and few researchers pay attention to solving large-scale optimization problems. Like NSGA-III, although it performs well in solving many-objective optimization problems, it does not perform well in large-scale optimization problems. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce the information feedback models to improve the ability of NSGA-III to solve large-scale optimization problems. In the feedback models, the historical information of individuals in the previous generations is used in the update process of the current generation. According to the different ways of selecting individual, information feedback models are divided into two categories: one is to select individuals in a fixed way (called M-F) and the other is to select individuals randomly (called M-R). For each type of model, if the number of individuals selected is different, the information feedback models also have some difference. According to the number and mode of individual selection, there are six models in this paper. These six models are respectively embedded into NSGA-III to generate six improving NSGA-III algorithms (these six algorithms are collectively referred to as IFM-NSGAIII). These six algorithms are compared with the original NSGA-III on 9 benchmark problems to search the best information feedback model and the best IFM-NSGAIII algorithm. Then the two best IFM-NSGAIII algorithms are compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms on 9 test functions. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms are highly competitive on test problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","IFM-NSGAIII; Large-scale optimization; Many-objective; NSGA-III; Terms-Information feedback models","Optimization; IFM-NSGAIII; Information feedback; Large-scale optimization; Many-objective; NSGA-III; Evolutionary algorithms","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41576011 , No. U1706218 , No. 41706010 , and No. 61503165 ).","Behavior of Adaptive Systems Which Employ Genetic and Correlation Algorithms, (1967); Kirkpatrick, Scott, Optimization by simulated annealing, Science, 220, 4598, pp. 671-680, (1983); Kennedy, James, Particle swarm optimization, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks - Conference Proceedings, 4, pp. 1942-1948, (1995); Proceedings of the First European Conference on Artificial Life, (1991); Technical Report, (1995); Evolutionary Computation, (1994); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Sang, Hongyan, An effective discrete invasive weed optimization algorithm for lot-streaming flowshop scheduling problems, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 29, 6, pp. 1337-1349, (2018); Li, Ming, Cryptanalysis of a chaotic image encryption scheme based on permutation-diffusion structure, Signal Processing: Image Communication, 62, pp. 164-172, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","0167739X","","FGCSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078845276"

Uncovering the correlations among these variables would be the most demanding task in this scenario, which require exclusive tools and techniques. Data-driven surrogate-assisted optimization is an ideal modeling approach, which eliminates the necessity of resource driven mathematical or simulation paradigms for the manufacturing process optimization. In this paper, a data-driven evolutionary algorithm is introduced, which is based on the improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). For objective approximation, the Gaussian Kernel Regression is selected. The multi-response manufacturing process data are employed to train this model. The proposed data-driven approach is generic, which could be evaluated for any type of manufacturing process. In order to verify the proposed methodology, a comprehensive number of cases are considered from the past literature. The proposed data-driven NSGA-III is compared with the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and shown to attain improved solutions within the imposed boundary conditions. Both the algorithms are shown to perform well using statistical analysis. The obtained results could be utilized to improve the machining conditions and performances. The novelty of this research is twofold, first, the surrogate-assisted NSGA III is implemented and second, the proposed approach is adopted for the multi-response manufacturing process optimization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data-driven surrogate model; Machining process optimization; Many-response parametric design; MOEA/D; NSGA-III","","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the SFI Manufacturing (Project No. 237900) and funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN).; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the SFI Manufacturing (Project No. 237900) and funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN) .","Afazov, Shukri M., Modelling and simulation of manufacturing process chains, CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 6, 1, pp. 70-77, (2013); Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering, (2012); Evolutionary Algorithms in Engineering Applications, (1997); Li, Wei, A surrogate thermal modeling and parametric optimization of battery pack with air cooling for EVs, Applied Thermal Engineering, 147, pp. 90-100, (2019); Wang, Handing, Data-driven surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary optimization of a trauma system, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 6, pp. 939-952, (2016); Rajan, Arvind, A simulation-based probabilistic framework for lithium-ion battery modelling, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 115, pp. 87-94, (2018); Vijayaraghavan, Venkatesh, Fracture mechanics modelling of lithium-ion batteries under pinch torsion test, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 114, pp. 382-389, (2018); Simpson, Timothy W., Design and analysis of computer experiments in multidisciplinary design optimization: A review of how far we have come - Or not, (2008); An, Yongkai, Surrogate model application to the identification of optimal groundwater exploitation scheme based on regression kriging method—a case study of Western Jilin province, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 12, 8, pp. 8897-8918, (2015); Optimization in Practice with Matlab, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22150986","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072829271"

Runtime behaviors of such systems are related to product configurations and information networks. Cost-effectively supporting Product Line Engineering (PLE) of such systems is challenging mainly because of lacking the support of automation of the configuration process. Capturing rules is the key for automating the configuration process in PLE. However, there does not exist explicitly-specified rules constraining configurable parameter values of such products and product lines. Manually specifying such rules is tedious and time-consuming. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present an improved version (named as SBRM+) of our previously proposed Search-based Rule Mining (SBRM) approach. SBRM+ incorporates two machine learning algorithms (i.e., C4.5 and PART) and two multi-objective search algorithms (i.e., NSGA-II and NSGA-III), employs a clustering algorithm (i.e., k means) for classifying rules as high or low confidence rules, which are used for defining three objectives to guide the search. To evaluate SBRM+ (i.e., SBRMNSGA-II+-C45, SBRMNSGA-III+-C45, SBRMNSGA-II+-PART, and SBRMNSGA-III+-PART), we performed two case studies (Cisco and Jitsi) and conducted three types of analyses of results: difference analysis, correlation analysis, and trend analysis. Results of the analyses show that all the SBRM+ approaches performed significantly better than two Random Search-based approaches (RBRM+-C45 and RBRM+-PART) in terms of fitness values, six quality indicators, and 17 machine learning quality measurements (MLQMs). As compared to RBRM+ approaches, SBRM+ approaches have improved the quality of rules based on MLQMs up to 27% for the Cisco case study and 28% for the Jitsi case study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Configuration; Interacting products; Machine learning; Multi-objective search; Product line; Rule mining","Cost engineering; Information services; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Configurable parameter; Configuration process; Correlation analysis; Information networks; Product configuration; Product line engineering; Quality indicators; Runtime behaviors; Learning algorithms","","","This work was supported by the Zen-Configurator project funded by the Research Council of Norway (Grant No. 240024/F20) under the category of Young Research Talents of the FRIPO funding scheme.

The fitness function of GWASF-GA is defined by an achievement scalarizing function (ASF) based on the Tchebychev distance, which considers two reference points (the nadir and utopian points) and a set of weight vectors. Despite of the benefits of using these two reference points simultaneously and a well-distributed set of weight vectors, it is necessary to go a step further to get better approximations in problems with complicated Pareto optimal fronts. For this, in A-GWASF-GA, some of the weight vectors are re-calculated during the optimization process based on the sparsity of the solutions found so far, and taking into account some theoretical results demonstrated in this paper regarding the ASF considered. Different strategies are carried out to accelerate the convergence and to maintain the diversity. The computational results, carried out in comparison with RVEA, NSGA-III, and different versions of MOEA/D, show the potential of A-GWASF-GA in well-known but also in novel many-objective optimization benchmark problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Achievement scalarizing function; Evolutionary algorithm; Many-objective optimization; Pareto optimal solutions; Weight vectors","Evolutionary algorithms; Pareto principle; Vectors; Bench-mark problems; Computational results; Fitness functions; Many-objective optimizations; Pareto optimal solutions; Pareto-optimal front; Scalarizing function; Weight vector; Genetic algorithms","","","This work has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (project ECO2017-88883-R) co-financed by FEDER funds, and by the Regional Government of Andalucía (PAI group SEJ-532), This research has also been partially supported by grant numbers TIN2017-88213-R (http://6city.lcc.uma.es) and RTC-2017-6714-5 (http://ecoiot.lcc.uma.es) and by Universidad de Málaga, Campus Internacional de Excelencia Andalucía TECH.

The objective of this work is to propose a new technique to optimize a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic controller with quality using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II by optimizing three objectives functions which are a cost function, the number of fuzzy inference rules, and the maximum instantaneous quadratic error. In this technique, the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making approach is used to choose one of the best controllers from the Pareto set of the last generation of the genetic algorithm. The proposed technique ensure: (i) that the output of the controlled system correctly follows the desired reference. (ii) the acceleration of the control process and (iii) avoid the existence of large overshoots; which are usually observed when applying commands to complex processes with variable behavior. At the end of the control process, a robustness test is performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed technique. It is shown here that the optimization of the third objective function, allows the improvement of the control quality. This new technique can be used to improve expert and intelligent systems based on fuzzy rules to control high complex systems with variable behavior which they have disturbing overshoots during their control. This technique; allows to accelerate the calculation of the control law of expert systems based on fuzzy rules; while ensuring that the quality of the control and the output signal are good. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fuzzy expert systems; Improved control quality; Multi-criteria decision making; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm; Nonlinear systems; Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic controller","Computer circuits; Controllers; Cost functions; Decision making; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Genetic algorithms; Inference engines; Intelligent systems; Nonlinear systems; Traffic signals; Fuzzy expert systems; Improved controls; Multi criteria decision making; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Takagi-sugeno fuzzy logic controllers; Process control","","","","Classical and Modern Controls with Microcontrollers Design Implementation and Applications, (2018); Bhosale, Ramchandra, Fuzzy logic control of the ultracapacitor interface for enhanced transient response and voltage stability of a dc microgrid, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 55, 1, pp. 712-720, (2019); Castillo, Oscar, A new approach to control of multivariable systems through a hierarchical aggregation of fuzzy controllers, Granular Computing, 4, 1, (2019); Intelligent Control Fuzzy Logic Applications, (1995); Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1917, pp. 849-858, (2000); Freire, Sérgio Miranda, A multiple criteria decision making system for setting priorities, IFMBE Proceedings, 68, 1, pp. 357-361, (2019); Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis State of the Art Surveys, (2005); Hilletofth, Per, Three novel fuzzy logic concepts applied to reshoring decision-making, Expert Systems with Applications, 126, pp. 133-143, (2019); Huang, Bingquan, Multi-objective feature selection by using NSGA-II for customer churn prediction in telecommunications, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 5, pp. 3638-3646, (2010)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076694687"

Multi-level thresholding (MTH) has been used to segment color images in recent years; this process considers each channel as a single grayscale image and applies the MTH independently. Although this method provides competitive results, the inherent relationship among color channels is disregarded. Such approaches generate spurious classes on overlapping regions, where new colors are generated, especially on the borders of the objects. The proposed multi-objective color thresholding (MOCTH) approach performs image segmentation while preserving the relationship between image channels. MOCTH is aimed to reduce the overlapping effect on segmented color images without performing additional post-processing. To measure the overlapping classes on a thresholded color image, the overlapping index is proposed to quantify the pixels affected. The presented approach is analyzed on two color spaces (RGB and CIE L*a*b*) using three multi-objective algorithms; they are NSGA-III, SPEA-2, and MOPSO. Results provide evidence pointing out to a better segmentation from MOCTH over the traditional single-objective approaches while reducing overlapped areas on the image. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-level thresholding; Multi-objective optimization; Overlapping Index","Color; Evolutionary algorithms; Image segmentation; Multiobjective optimization; Pixels; Color thresholding; Gray-scale images; Multi objective algorithm; Multilevel thresholding; Overlapping effect; Overlapping index; Overlapping regions; Thresholding segmentation; Color image processing","","","The first author acknowledges The National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) for the doctoral Grant Number 298285 for supporting this research.","Agrawal, Sanjay, Tsallis entropy based optimal multilevel thresholding using cuckoo search algorithm, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 11, pp. 16-30, (2013); Akay, B., A study on particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithms for multilevel thresholding, Applied Soft Computing, 13, 6, pp. 3066-3091, (2013); Banerjee, Suman, Color image segmentation using cauchy-mutated PSO, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 343, pp. 239-250, (2015); Bhandari, Ashish Kumar, Cuckoo search algorithm and wind driven optimization based study of satellite image segmentation for multilevel thresholding using Kapur's entropy, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 7, pp. 3538-3560, (2014); Bhandari, Ashish Kumar, Modified artificial bee colony based computationally efficient multilevel thresholding for satellite image segmentation using Kapur's, Otsu and Tsallis functions, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 3, pp. 1573-1601, (2015); Bhandari, Ashish Kumar, Tsallis entropy based multilevel thresholding for colored satellite image segmentation using evolutionary algorithms, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 22, pp. 8707-8730, (2015); Coello, Carlos A., Evolutionary multi-objective optimization: Some current research trends and topics that remain to be explored, Frontiers of Computer Science in China, 3, 1, pp. 18-30, (2009); Coello, Carlos A., Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 8, 3, pp. 256-279, (2004); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Multi-objective genetic algorithms: problem difficulties and construction of test problems., Evolutionary Computation, 7, 3, pp. 205-230, (1999); Ieeexplore Ieee Org, (2013)","","Springer","","","","","","14327643; 14337479","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072106487"

In the proposed RD-EMO, a set of reference points are generated and the objective space is divided into a set of regions through angle bisectors between adjacent reference lines. Then two attributions of regions are defined, which are region degree and region sparse rate, respectively. Region attributions based select operator is designed to choose solutions in sparse regions of objective space as mating solutions so that new solutions created by mating solutions can be located in sparser regions. In addition, region sparse rate is also applied to the population update process so that solutions in sparse regions of objective space are reserved and those in dense regions are discarded. Hence, two attributions of regions can better guarantee population diversity. Moreover, those solutions with better scalar function values are reserved in the same intensity regions so that population convergence is also guaranteed. In the study of the performance of the proposed algorithm, the performance comparison of RD-EMO with some state-of-the-art algorithms including NSGA-III, MOEA/D-PBI, MOEA/DD, RVEA and MOEA/D-M2M in solving a set of well-known multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) having 3 to 15 objectives shows that the proposed RD-EMO is superior in converging to approximate Pareto Front (PF) with a standout distribution.

The IoV users can offload their computing tasks to the edge computing devices (ECDs) for low latency execution and the cloud can be engaged to process big data with sufficient computing resources. Though galactic convenience brought by the IoV cloud-edge computing system,it remains a challenge to manage the resource of ECDs by reducing the energy and time consumption while avoiding the situation of overload or underload of the ECDs to maintain the system-stability. Moreover, during the movement of the vehicles, the computing tasks and data may be uploaded to different ECDs and the data continuity may be destroyed. In this paper, a multi-objective computation offloading method (MOC) for IoV in cloud-edge computing is proposed to deal with the challenges above. A vehicle-to-vehicle communication-based route obtaining algorithm is designed first.Then, in order to ensure the trustworth of the IoV data, which ECD to upload the computing tasks to is selected. Under the case that all ECDs are overloaded, the computation offloading between ECDs and cloud is considered. In addition, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to realize the multi-objective optimization of decreasing the load balancing rate and reduce the energy consumption in ECDs and shorten the time during processing the computing tasks.

However, the increasing users’ requirements of migrating tasks pose a challenge to preserve the security and integrity of offloaded data which are processed by cloudlets. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-based cloudlet management method for multimedia workflow, named MWSM, is proposed in this paper.

Due to some real-world requirements, a typical trajectory optimization model may need to be formulated containing several objectives. Because of the discontinuity or nonlinearity in the vehicle dynamics and mission objectives, it is challenging to generate a compromised trajectory that can satisfy constraints and optimize objectives. To address the multiobjective trajectory planning problem, this paper applies a specific multiple-shooting discretization technique with the newest NSGA-III optimization algorithm and constructs a new evolutionary optimal control solver. In addition, three constraint handling algorithms are incorporated in this evolutionary optimal control framework. The performance of using different constraint handling strategies is detailed and analyzed. The proposed approach is compared with other well-developed multiobjective techniques. Experimental studies demonstrate that the present method can outperform other evolutionary-based solvers investigated in this paper with respect to convergence ability and distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions. Therefore, the present evolutionary optimal control solver is more attractive and can offer an alternative for optimizing multiobjective continuous-time trajectory optimization problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multiobjective optimal control; multiple-shooting; NSGA-III optimization; Pareto-optimal; trajectory optimization","Aerodynamics; Constrained optimization; Continuous time systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Pareto principle; Planning; Trajectories; Vehicles; Multi-objective optimal control; Multiple shooting; Optimal controls; Pareto-optimal; Space vehicles; Trajectory optimization; Vehicle dynamics; Multiobjective optimization; article; evolutionary algorithm; experimental study","","","","Narayan, Pritesh, Embedding human expert cognition into autonomous UAS trajectory planning, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 43, 2, pp. 530-541, (2013); Rucco, Alessandro, An efficient minimum-time trajectory generation strategy for two-track car vehicles, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 23, 4, pp. 1505-1519, (2015); Chen, Zhiyong Yong, A Minimal Control Multiagent for Collision Avoidance and Velocity Alignment, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 47, 8, pp. 2185-2192, (2017); Häusler, Andreas J., Energy-Optimal Motion Planning for Multiple Robotic Vehicles With Collision Avoidance, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 24, 3, pp. 867-883, (2016); Paull, Liam, Sensor-driven area coverage for an autonomous fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 44, 9, pp. 1605-1618, (2014); Peng, Haijun, Multi-objective transfer to libration-point orbits via the mixed low-thrust and invariant-manifold approach, Nonlinear Dynamics, 77, 1-2, pp. 321-338, (2014); Peng, Haijun, Adaptive surrogate model based multi-objective transfer trajectory optimization between different libration points, Advances in Space Research, 58, 7, pp. 1331-1347, (2016); Wang, Wei, A fast multi-objective optimization design method for emergency libration point orbits transfer between the Sun–Earth and the Earth–Moon systems, Aerospace Science and Technology, 63, pp. 152-166, (2017); Yang, Chenguang, Trajectory planning and optimized adaptive control for a class of wheeled inverted pendulum vehicle models, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 43, 1, pp. 24-36, (2013); Albin Rajasingham, Thivaharan, In-vehicle realization of nonlinear MPC for gasoline two-stage turbocharging airpath control, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 26, 5, pp. 1606-1618, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21682267; 21682275","","","30489277","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057384948"

This study focuses on the dynamic flexible job shop-scheduling problem considering the deterioration effect (DFJSP-DE). Two types of disturbances are considered, i.e. the implicit disturbance caused by the deterioration effect and the explicit disturbance caused by the reprocessing of unqualified jobs. Firstly, a stepdeterioration effect model is proposed, with which the actual processing time of each operation can be predicted more accurately. A multi-objective optimisation model is formulated for the DFJSP-DE. The makespan, energy consumption, and stability of rescheduling solutions are three objectives to be optimised simultaneously. For this non-deterministic polynominal (NP)-hard problem, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III is employed to search the Pareto solutions for the DFJSPDE. Finally, the results of three numerical experiments show that the proposed approach can solve DFJSP-DE effectively and efficiently. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Cutting tools; Deterioration; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling; Stochastic systems; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Multi objective; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Numerical experiments; Pareto solution; Processing time; Production process; Stochastic events; Job shop scheduling","","","","Pinedo, Michael L., Scheduling: Theory, algorithms, and systems, pp. 1-671, (2008); Djamila Ouelhadj, Djamila, A survey of dynamic scheduling in manufacturing systems, Journal of Scheduling, 12, 4, pp. 417-431, (2009); Sabuncuoĝlu, Ihsan, Hedging production schedules against uncertainty in manufacturing environment with a review of robustness and stability research, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 22, 2, pp. 138-157, (2009); Vieira, Guilherme Ernani, Rescheduling manufacturing systems: A framework of strategies, policies, and methods, Journal of Scheduling, 6, 1, pp. 39-62, (2003); Lee, Kangbok, Online scheduling of ordered flow shops, European Journal of Operational Research, 272, 1, pp. 50-60, (2019); Eur J Oper Res, (2017); Wang, Qian, Online algorithms for scheduling on batch processing machines with interval graph compatibilities between jobs, Theoretical Computer Science, 700, pp. 37-44, (2017); Ding, Ning, Online minimum makespan scheduling with a buffer, International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science, 25, 5, pp. 525-536, (2014); Wu, Qidi, Data-driven dynamic scheduling method for semiconductor production line, Kongzhi Lilun Yu Yingyong/Control Theory and Applications, 32, 9, pp. 1233-1239, (2015); Shen, Xiaoning, Mathematical modeling and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms applied to dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problems, Information Sciences, 298, pp. 198-224, (2015)","","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","","","","","25168398","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103803011"

Visualisation offers a way of presenting the results of such benchmarking so that a non-expert user can understand how their algorithm is performing. By examining the characteristics of their algorithm, such as convergence and diversity, the user can learn how effective their chosen algorithm parametrisation is. This paper presents a technique intended to offer this insight, by presenting the relative performance of a set of EAs optimising the same multi-objective problem in a simple visualisation. The visualisation characterises the behaviour of the algorithm in terms of known performance indicators drawn from the literature, and is capable of visualising the optimisation of many-objective problems also. The method is demonstrated with benchmark test problems from the popular DTLZ and CEC 2009 problem suites, optimising them with different parametrisations of both NSGA-II and NSGA-III, and it is shown that known characteristics of optimisers solving these problems can be observed in the visualisations resulting. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benchmarking; Many-objective; Multi-objective; Optimisation; Parametrisation; Visualisation","Benchmarking; Parameter estimation; Visualization; Bench-mark-test problems; Many-objective; Multi objective; Multi-objective problem; Objective optimisation; Optimisations; Parametrisation; Performance indicators; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","de Jong, Kenneth A., Parameter setting in EAs: A 30 year perspective, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 54, pp. 1-18, (2007); Eiben, Ágoston Endre, Parameter control in evolutionary algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 3, 2, pp. 124-141, (1999); Walker, David J., Visualizing mutually nondominating solution sets in many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 17, 2, pp. 165-184, (2013); Hart, Emma, GAVEL - A new tool for genetic algorithm visualization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 5, 4, pp. 335-348, (2001); Keedwell, Edward C., Spatial and temporal visualisation of evolutionary algorithm decisions in water distribution network optimisation, pp. 941-948, (2015); Walker, David J., Toward the Online Visualisation of Algorithm Performance for Parameter Selection, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10784 LNCS, pp. 547-560, (2018); International Conference on Hydroinformatics, (2018); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Scalable multi-objective optimization test problems, 1, pp. 825-830, (2002); Multiobjective Optimization Test Instances for the CEC 2009 Special Session and Competition, (2008); Farina, Marco, On the optimal solution definition for many-criteria optimization problems, Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society - NAFIPS, 2002-January, pp. 233-238, (2002)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15684946","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076567782"

However, these maps suffer from hyper-parameters tuning issues. These parameters are generally selected on hit and trial basis. However, inappropriate selection of these parameters may reduce the performance of chaotic maps. Also, these hyper-parameters are not sensitive to input images. Therefore, in this paper, to handle these issues, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA) based 4-D chaotic map is designed. Additionally, to improve the computational speed of the proposed approach, we have designed a novel master-slave model for image encryption. Initially, computationally expensive operations such as mutation and crossover of NSGA-III are identified. Thereafter, NSGA-III parameters are split among two jobs, i.e., master and slave jobs. For communication between master and slave nodes, the message passing interface is used. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed image encryption technique outperforms the existing techniques in terms of various performance measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","4-D chaotic map; Image encryption; NSGA-III; Security evaluation","Chaotic systems; Genetic algorithms; Image enhancement; Lyapunov methods; Message passing; Chaotic map; Computational speed; Image encryptions; Message passing interface; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-III; Performance measure; Security evaluation; Cryptography","","","","Afarin, Roza, Image encryption using genetic algorithm, Iranian Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing, MVIP, pp. 441-445, (2013); Belazi, Akram, A novel image encryption scheme based on substitution-permutation network and chaos, Signal Processing, 128, pp. 155-170, (2016); Chatterjee, Amit, Optical Image Encryption using Fringe Projection Profilometry, Fourier Fringe Analysis, and RSA Algorithm, (2018); Chen, Guanrong (Ron), A symmetric image encryption scheme based on 3D chaotic cat maps, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 21, 3, pp. 749-761, (2004); Chuman, Tatsuya, Encryption-Then-Compression Systems Using Grayscale-Based Image Encryption for JPEG Images, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 14, 6, pp. 1515-1525, (2019); Campos Ciro, Guillermo, A NSGA-II and NSGA-III comparison for solving an open shop scheduling problem with resource constraints, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, 12, pp. 1272-1277, (2016); Das, Ramkrishna Dev, Cumulative image encryption approach based on user defined operation, character repositioning, text key and image key encryption technique and secret sharing scheme, pp. 748-753, (2018); Du, Shiping, Enhanced double random phase encryption of quantum images, Results in Physics, 13, (2019); El-Assad, Safwan Al, A new chaos-based image encryption system, Signal Processing: Image Communication, 41, pp. 144-157, (2016); Gao, Haojiang, A new chaotic algorithm for image encryption, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 29, 2, pp. 393-399, (2006)","","Springer","","","","","","18685145; 18685137","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073819343"

Furthermore, the cloud-based CPS bring massive computing and storage resource for CPS, which enables a wide range of applications. Meanwhile, due to the explosive expansion of applications deployed on the CPS, the energy consumption of the cloud-based CPS has received wide concern. To improve the energy efficiency in the cloud environment, the virtualized technology is employed to manage the resources, and the applications are generally hosted by virtual machines (VMs). However, it remains challenging to meet the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In view of this challenge, a QoS-aware VM scheduling method for energy conservation, named QVMS, in cloud-based CPS is designed. Technically, our scheduling problem is formalized as a standard multi-objective problem first.

In this study, the macro geometry of a helical gear pair was optimized for low weight, high efficiency, and low noise; further, trends of optimal solutions for five combinations of the three objectives were analyzed. The gear mass and efficiency were directly used as the design objectives. However, since the calculation of the gear noise is generally very complicated and time-consuming, the gear noise has not been directly used as the design objective, and the peak-to-peak static transmission error (PPSTE), which is the main source of the gear vibration, was selected as the design objective for the gear noise in the optimization. The objectives exhibited a trade-off relation between each other in the optimal space. If one of them was omitted, the objective considerably deteriorated. To analyze the results, the objectives were normalized and scored. As a result, most of the top ranks were from the optimal solutions considering the mass, efficiency, and PPSTE. Therefore, all three objectives should be considered in the gear optimization for low weight, high efficiency, and low noise. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Helical gear; Macro geometry; NSGA-III; Optimization; Transmission error","Acoustic noise measurement; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Errors; Geometry; Optimal systems; Optimization; Vibrations (mechanical); Design objectives; Gear vibration; Geometry optimization; High-efficiency; NSGA-III; Optimal solutions; Static transmission errors; Transmission error; Helical gears","","","","Yokota, Takao, A solution method for optimal weight design problem of the gear using genetic algorithms, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 35, 3-4, pp. 523-526, (1998); Thompson, David F., Tradeoff analysis in minimum volume design of multi-stage spur gear reduction units, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 35, 5, pp. 609-627, (2000); Mendi, Faruk, Optimization of module, shaft diameter and rolling bearing for spur gear through genetic algorithm, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 12, pp. 8058-8064, (2010); Savsani, Vimal J., Optimal weight design of a gear train using particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithms, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 45, 3, pp. 531-541, (2010); Golabi, Sa’id, Gear train optimization based on minimum volume/weight design, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 73, pp. 197-217, (2014); Miler, Daniel, Influence of profile shift on the spur gear pair optimization, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 117, pp. 189-197, (2017); Miler, Daniel, Multi-objective spur gear pair optimization focused on volume and efficiency, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 125, pp. 185-195, (2018); Patil, Maruti, Multi-Objective Optimization of Two Stage Spur Gearbox Using NSGA-II, SAE Technical Papers, 2017-July, July, (2017); Patil, Maruti, Multi-objective optimization of the two-stage helical gearbox with tribological constraints, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 138, pp. 38-57, (2019); Wang, Xigui, Multi-objective optimization modification of a tooth surface with minimum of flash temperature and vibration acceleration RMS, Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology, 32, 7, pp. 3097-3106, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","0094114X","0080311318","MHMTA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073520045"

We express the proposed EA with different asynchrony as a semi-asynchronous EA. A semi-asynchronous EA generates new solutions whenever evaluations of the predefined number of solutions complete, unlike a conventional synchronous EA waits for evaluations of all solutions to generate the next population. To establish a semi-asynchronous EA, this paper introduces an asynchrony parameter that is used to decide how many solutions are waited to generate new solutions. We conduct an experiment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed semi-asynchronous EA on benchmark problems with the several variances of the evaluation time. In the experiment, we apply a semi-asynchronous EA to NSGA-II and NSGA-III, which are well-known multi-objective EAs. The semi-asynchronous NSGA-IIs and the semi-asynchronous NSGA-IIIs with different asynchronies are compared on multi-objective optimization benchmark problems. The experimental result reveals that semi-asynchronous approaches with an appropriate asynchrony have possibility to outperform the asynchronous and the synchronous ones. Additionally, detailed analysis reveals that an appropriate asynchrony may vary not only depends on a target problem but also depends on the degree of the evolution process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asynchronous evolutionary algorithm; Asynchrony; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-II; NSGA-III","Benchmarking; Evolutionary algorithms; Asynchrony; Bench-mark problems; Evolution process; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization problem; NSGA-II; NSGA-III; Parallel evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) Grant Number JP16KT0103.","Akay, B., Synchronous and asynchronous Pareto-based multi-objective Artificial Bee Colony algorithms, Journal of Global Optimization, 57, 2, pp. 415-445, (2013); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Proceedings of the Workshop on Particle Swarm Optimization, (2001); Chang, Juifang, A parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm with communication strategies, Journal of Information Science and Engineering, 21, 4, pp. 809-818, (2005); Parallel and Distributed Computing Handbook, (1996); Complex Systems, (1995); Computer Science and Informatics, (1996); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Depolli, Matjaž, Asynchronous master-slave parallelization of differential evolution for multi-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 21, 2, pp. 261-291, (2013)","","Springer","","","","","","14327643; 14337479","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066099031"

Due to the existence of internal and external uncertainties, the robust optimization approach is selected. We have defined and examined the robustness in terms of resources, in which, uncertainty can be the cause of wasted resources. On the other hand, the existing methods in the literature measure robustness in terms of the objective functions. These methods, which implicitly suppose equal objective weights, use the measure of the diameter of sensitivity region of a solution as robustness index. This is in contradiction to the philosophy of the posterior preferences decision-making approach. Therefore, we have proposed a novel robustness index based on the new concept of preferential weights of each portfolio and deduced a formula based on the normal vectors of bounding hyperplanes of the Pareto frontier. Then, the relationship between the two newly defined robustness indexes is investigated. Finally, an efficient heuristic is developed and applied in a case study as well as a numerical example. In addition, our proposed robustness concept is compared to an existing concept in the literature. Results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented concept and the proposed algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-objective robustness; NSGA-III; Project portfolio optimization; Simulated annealing; Uncertainty","Decision making; Financial data processing; Multiobjective optimization; External uncertainties; Interval uncertainty; Multi objective; Multi-objective robustness; NSGA-III; Optimization problems; Project portfolio optimization; Robust optimization; Robustness index; Uncertainty; Simulated annealing","","","We gratefully thank our colleagues from Sina Port and Marine Company who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted the research.","Ben Abdelaziz, Fouad, Solution approaches for the multiobjective stochastic programming, European Journal of Operational Research, 216, 1, pp. 1-16, (2012); Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Atlanta GA Usa, (2008); Avis, David, How good are convex hull algorithms?, Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications, 7, 5-6, pp. 265-301, (1997); Avis, David, A pivoting algorithm for convex hulls and vertex enumeration of arrangements and polyhedra, Discrete and Computational Geometry, 8, 1, pp. 295-313, (1992); Barber, C.

These problems are commonly termed dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). One challenge associated with solving such problems is the fact that the Pareto front or Pareto set often changes too quickly. This means that the optimal solution set at period t may likely vary from that at (t+1), and this makes the process of optimizing such problems computationally expensive to implement. This article proposes the use of adaptive mutation and crossover operators for the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). The aim is to find solutions that can adapt to fitness changes in the objective function space over time. The proposed approach improves the capability of NSGA-III to solve multi-objective optimization problems with solutions that change quickly in both space and time. Results obtained show that this method of population reinitialization can effectively optimize selected benchmark dynamic problems. In addition, we test the capability of the proposed algorithm to select robust solutions over time. We recognize that DMOPs are characterized by rapidly changing optimal solutions. Therefore, we also test the ability of our proposed algorithm to handle these changes. This is achieved by evaluating its performance on selected robust optimization over time (ROOT) and robust Pareto-optimality over time (RPOOT) benchmark problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Diversity; Dynamic multi-objective optimization; Inverted generational distance; Reference points","Benchmarking; Genetic algorithms; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Bench-mark problems; Dynamic multiobjective optimization; Multi-objective optimization problem; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective functions; Optimal solution sets; Real-world problem; Robust optimization; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported in part by the South African National Research Foundation under Grant 112108 and Grant 112142, in part by the South African National Research Foundation Incentive under Grant 95687, and in part by the Eskom Tertiary Education Support Programme, Research Grant from URC of University of Johannesburg.","Abello, Manuel Blanco, An adaptive approach for solving dynamic scheduling with time-varying number of tasks - Part i, pp. 1703-1710, (2011); Ding, Jinliang, Dynamic Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization for Raw Ore Allocation in Mineral Processing, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, 3, 1, pp. 36-48, (2019); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Dynamic multi-objective optimization and decision-making using modified NSGA-II: A case study on hydro-thermal power scheduling, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4403 LNCS, pp. 803-817, (2007); Hutzschenreuter, Anke K., Evolutionary multiobjective optimization for dynamic hospital resource management, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5467 LNCS, pp. 320-334, (2010); Zhou, Aimin Min, A Population prediction strategy for evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 44, 1, pp. 40-53, (2014); Guo, Yi'nan, Novel Interactive Preference-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization for Bolt Supporting Networks, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 24, 4, pp. 750-764, (2020); Guo, Yi'nan, Robust Dynamic Multi-Objective Vehicle Routing Optimization Method, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, 15, 6, pp. 1891-1903, (2018); Helbig, Mardé, Heterogeneous dynamic vector evaluated particle swarm optimisation for dynamic multi-objective optimisation, pp. 3151-3159, (2014); Maltese, Justin, A Scalability Study of Many-Objective Optimization Algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 22, 1, pp. 79-96, (2018); Jin, Yaochu, Reference point based prediction for evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization, pp. 3769-3776, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102802753"

Intelligent job shop scheduling problem is the core decision of intelligent manufacturing production management. Many-objective job shop scheduling algorithms can effectively solve this problem. However, existing optimization algorithms cannot effectively solve many-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem. This paper establishes the many-objective job shop intelligent scheduling model with complex constraints, and proposes an improved intelligent decision optimization algorithm named NSGA-III-APEV based on NSGA-III. This algorithm uses the penalty-based boundary intersection distance that takes into account both convergence and diversity simultaneously to define the distance between the population individual and the reference vector in the association operation. This paper exploits the penalty-based boundary intersection distance-based elimi- nation mechanism to preserve individuals and reduce the computational cost in the individual preservation strategy. Meanwhile, the adaptive mutation strategy based on consanguinity is employed in genetic operators. The presented method effectively improves the convergence and diversity of the population. Finally, NSGA-III-APEV with other algorithms was compared through benchmarks. Experimental results demon- strated the effectiveness and superiority of the improved method.

To effectively deal with the many-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problems, a novel NSGA-FA algorithm which alleviates the limitation of local optimum is put forward in this paper. The NSGA-FA algorithm combines the special sorting rule of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-Ⅲ (NSGA-Ⅲ) and the location-updating mechanism of many-objective firefly algorithm (MFA). Furthermore, the optimal elite guidance (E<inf>-guide</inf>) mechanism and the non-duplicate elite solution storage (NDES) strategy are proposed to optimize operation-efficiency and solution-diversity of NSGA-FA algorithm. The applicability and preponderance of NSGA-FA algorithm compared with NSGA-Ⅲ and MFA methods are evaluated by both bi-objective and tri-objective MOOPF experiments on IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems. Furthermore, the hyper-volume (HV) metric and the detailed results of five simulation trials intuitively indicate that the presented NSGA-FA algorithm achieves the more preferable Pareto front (PF) with superior-diversity and fast-convergence.

The increase also preceded the development of higher-specification motors. Although weight, cogging torque, torque ripples and drive technology etc. for the working area are important, the demand for the production of highly efficient and cost-effective motors has risen further due to the energy phenomenon in the world. High-quality algorithms are needed to achieve these objectives as well, because electric motor designs are multi-parameter and nonlinear engineering problems. This study aims to provide a multi-purpose intelligent design with NSGAII and NSGAIII by selecting outputs such as efficiency and cost of permanent magnet synchronous motor as an objective function. The design was intended for low speed and high torque/volume applications and the motor geometry was thus chosen as surface-mounted and double-layer concentrated winding. The optimization results were tested with a finite element program. Both methods resulted in a 3% increase in efficiency and a 37% reduction in cost versus initial design. Also, according to the results obtained, although NSGA-II and NSGA-III achieved similar results, NSGA-III results showed a more robust and stable course than NSGA-II results. The compatibility of the design optimization and the results of numerical analysis are acceptable and highly satisfactory.

The assembly variation analysis model ofthe conceptual design stage was established. Afterwards, the assembly tolerance function was used to analyze the quality ofthe assembly, and the exponential function was selected as the cost model. Based on the above functions, a multi-objective optimization model was established. The N S G A - I I I algorithm occurred, which can be used to optimize the tolerance allocation ofthe selected sequence, the optimal assembly sequence and the Pareto solution set ofthe multi-objective function.

The increasing penetration of renewable generation significantly challenge the economic and security of power system operation. In this paper, a low carbon multi-objective objective unit commitment model considering economic cost, environmental cost and, more importantly, the carbon emission is established, integrating wind and solar power and therefore generating a multi-objective, high-dimensional, strong non-linear, multi-constraint and mixed integer optimization problem. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III is tailored and adopted for solving the proposed challenging task, where the decision-making scheme is designed according to the normalization method and weighted sum function.

This paradigm is particularly suitable to solve resource-greedy scientific computing applications such as parameter sweep experiments (PSEs). Through the implementation of autoscalers, the virtual infrastructure can be scaled up and down by acquiring or terminating instances of virtual machines (VMs) at the time that application tasks are being scheduled. In this paper, we extend an existing study centered in a state-of-the-art autoscaler called multiobjective evolutionary autoscaler (MOEA). MOEA uses a multiobjective optimization algorithm to determine the set of possible virtual infrastructure settings. In this context, the performance of MOEA is greatly influenced by the underlying optimization algorithm used and its tuning. Therefore, we analyze two well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II and NSGA-III) and how they impact on the performance of the MOEA autoscaler. Simulated experiments with three real-world PSEs show that MOEA gets significantly improved when using NSGA-III instead of NSGA-II due to the former provides a better exploitation versus exploration trade-off. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Storage as a service (STaaS); Application tasks; Comparative analysis; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective evolutionary; Optimization algorithms; Scientific computing applications; Simulated experiments; Virtual infrastructures; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","Mauch, Viktor, High performance cloud computing, Future Generation Computer Systems, 29, 6, pp. 1408-1416, (2013); García-Garino, Carlos, Numerical simulation of finite strain viscoplastic problems, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 246, pp. 174-184, (2013); Pacini, Elina, A bio-inspired scheduler for minimizing makespan and flowtime of computational mechanics applications on federated clouds, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 31, 3, pp. 1731-1743, (2016); Buyya, Rajkumar, Cloud computing and emerging IT platforms: Vision, hype, and reality for delivering computing as the 5th utility, Future Generation Computer Systems, 25, 6, pp. 599-616, (2009); Monge, David A., Autoscaling scientific workflows on the cloud by combining on-demand and spot instances, Computer Systems Science and Engineering, 32, 4, pp. 291-306, (2017); Mao, Ming, Auto-scaling to minimize cost and meet application deadlines in cloud workflows, (2011); Mao, Ming, Scaling and scheduling to maximize application performance within budget constraints in cloud workflows, pp. 67-78, (2013); Cai, Zhicheng, A delay-based dynamic scheduling algorithm for bag-of-task workflows with stochastic task execution times in clouds, Future Generation Computer Systems, 71, pp. 57-72, (2017); Li, Jian, Cost-efficient coordinated scheduling for leasing cloud resources on hybrid workloads, Parallel Computing, 44, pp. 1-17, (2015); De Coninck, Elias, Dynamic auto-scaling and scheduling of deadline constrained service workloads on IaaS clouds, Journal of Systems and Software, 118, pp. 101-114, (2016)","","Hindawi Limited 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb New York NY 10022","","","","","","10589244","","SCIPE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092073772"

The liquid flow rate and the nozzle length are considered as the design criteria. Two Differential Evolution variants are proposed to obtain a set of design configurations that presents numerous and different synergies between the design criteria. The first variant is based on the Hypervolume performance metric (MODE-HVR) and the second one includes the -dominance concept (MODE-HV R). A comparative study is performed with other optimizers from well-established search approaches for multi-objective optimization such as algorithms based on Pareto dominance (NSGA-II and SPEA2), decomposition (MOEA/D), metric (SMS-EMOA) and hybrid (NSGA-III). Based on the Spacing and Hypervolume indicators of the obtained Pareto fronts, the proposed optimization algorithms can provide more design solutions, promoting the reconfigurability (synergy) in the nozzle design. Hence, the multi-objective design strategy allows the designer to have a wide range of solutions and to choose the most suitable one for a particular application, compared with a traditional design where both design criteria are considered as a single aggregate function. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","multi-objective optimization; multi-objective search approaches; optimization.; Optimum nozzle design","Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Comparative studies; Design configurations; Differential Evolution; Fluid dynamics model; Hypervolume indicators; Multi-objective design; Optimization algorithms; Performance metrices; Nozzle design","","","This work was supported in part by the Secretaría de Investigación y Posgrado (SIP) under Project 20190239 and Project 20181312, in part by the Comisión de Operación y Fomento de Actividades Académicas (COFAA), and in part by the Coordinación de Proyectos Especiales of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).","Ashurst, Philip R., Chemistry and technology of soft drinks and fruit juices, pp. 1-405, (2016); van Wezel, Wout M.C., The planning flexibility bottleneck in food processing industries, Journal of Operations Management, 24, 3, pp. 287-300, (2006); Ruiz, Édu, Optimization of injection flow rate to minimize micro/macro-voids formation in resin transfer molded composites, Composites Science and Technology, 66, 3-4, pp. 475-486, (2006); Multicriterion Optimization in Engineering, (1984); Caprace, Jean David Job Emmanuel Marie, Scantling multi-objective optimisation of a LNG carrier, Marine Structures, 23, 3, pp. 288-302, (2010); Husseinzadeh Kashan, Ali, A new metaheuristic for optimization: Optics inspired optimization (OIO), Computers and Operations Research, 55, pp. 99-125, (2015); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007); Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Expósito Carrillo, José Antonio, Single-phase ejector geometry optimisation by means of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and a surrogate CFD model, Energy, 164, pp. 46-64, (2018); Kulkarni, Kishor, Multi-objective optimization of a double-layered microchannel heat sink with temperature-dependent fluid properties, Applied Thermal Engineering, 99, pp. 262-272, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089540318"

The OTLAMRMC problem contains two sub-problems: the reliabilities and assignment cost evaluation under the transmission time constraint (RACETTC) and the multi-objective transmission line assignment optimization problem. First, the RACETTC algorithm is proposed to evaluate reliabilities and assignment cost under the transmission time constraints for a certain transmission line configuration. Then, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) is adopted to search the optimal transmission line assignment based on the results obtained by the RACETTC algorithm. Therefore, combining the RACETTC algorithm and the NSGA-III together, the RACETTC-NSGA-III algorithm is proposed to solve the OTLAMRMC problem. Finally, example simulations are given to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

In E-projects portfolio selection (EPPS) problem, big data-driven decision-making has a great importance in web development environments. EPPS problem deals with choosing a set of the best investment projects on social media such that maximum return with minimum risk is achieved. To optimize the EPPS problem on social media, this study aims to develop a hybrid fuzzy multi-objective optimization algorithm, named as NSGA-III-MOIWO encompassing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and multi-objective invasive weed optimization (MOIWO) algorithms. The objectives are to simultaneously minimize variance, skewness and kurtosis as the risk measures and maximize the total expected return. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm, the data derived from 125 active E-projects in an Iranian web development company are analyzed and employed over the period 2014-2018. Finally, the obtained experimental results provide the optimal policy based on the main limitations of the system and it is demonstrated that the NSGA-III-MOIWO outperforms the NSGA-III and MOIWO in finding efficient investment boundaries in EPPS problems.

These aims are conflicting with one another, and a choice must be made in the presence of the trade-off between them. Numerous researches deal with feature selection problem but, they are mostly single-objective based. Nowadays, multi-objective optimisation approaches are becoming the most suitable approaches to deal with feature selection problems. They can easily create a balance between selected features and classification accuracy or error rate. Evolutionary computation techniques have been applied for multi-objective feature selection. Cuckoo optimisation algorithm is among the most popular technique that is exceptional in solving the problems of feature selection. Based on the binary cuckoo optimisation algorithm, two different multi-objective filter-based feature selection frameworks are presented with the idea of nondominated sorting genetic algorithms NSGAIII (BCNSG3) along with NSGAII (BCNSG2). Thus, four multi-objective filter-based feature selection approaches are proposed by employing mutual information along with gain ratio based-entropy as the respective filter evaluation measures in all the proposed frameworks. The results obtained are examined and analysed against the existing methods and single objective scheme on fourteen (14) datasets of varying degree of difficulties. The outcome of the experiments displays that the proposed multi-objective algorithms successfully derive a set of nondominated solutions that used the least feature size and attained the best error rate than using full-length features.

The challenge of the problem lies in uncertainties involved from both structural parameters and loads, which renders the fatigue reliability becoming the primary problem to be considered in evaluating structural performance. In order to obtain the optimal fatigue reliability, the optimal mathematical models aiming at the mass and fatigue life of welding robots are constructed respectively, and the genetic particle swarm optimization algorithm and radial basis function neural network (GAPSO-RBFNN) based surrogate model is then presented. Moreover, fuzzy constraints are introduced into the optimization model, and the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-III) optimization strategy is proposed to solve it, which can effectively reduce the workload by increasing the diversity of Pareto solutions during the iterative process. Finally, the optimized structure combined with numerical simulation method is adopted to analyze the fatigue reliability.

However, the existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not efficient enough in analyzing network traffic data for anomaly detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a new data processing model for network anomaly detection. The model can simultaneously optimize the number of features (NF), accuracy, recall, false alarm rate (FAR) and precision. In order to better solve the model, an integrating dominance algorithm (MaOEA-ABC) with adaptive selection probability is proposed. In model, firstly, MaOEA-ABC is used to obtain the optimal feature subset by optimizing the above five objectives. Then, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is used for network anomaly classification according to the optimal feature subset. Finally, MaOEA-ABC is compared with the existing standard MaOEAs algorithm (NSGA-III, EFR-RR, MaOEA-RD and PICEAg). The experimental results show that the approach can reduce the number of features on the basis of ensuring accuracy and FAR, thereby reducing the cost of detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud computing; feature selection; intrusion detection system; many-objective optimization; network anomaly detection","Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Adaptive selection; Cloud computing technologies; Cloud environments; Data processing models; Intrusion Detection Systems; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Network anomalies; Network anomaly detection; Anomaly detection","","","This work was supported in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi Province (High Technology) under Grant 201903D121119, and in part by the Postgraduate Education Innovation Project of Shanxi Province under Grant 2019SY495.","Sabahi, Farzad, Cloud computing security threats and responses, pp. 245-249, (2011); Lim, Dudy, Efficient Hierarchical Parallel Genetic Algorithms using Grid computing, Future Generation Computer Systems, 23, 4, pp. 658-670, (2007); Chen, Guoliang, Integrated research of parallel computing: Status and future, Chinese Science Bulletin, 54, 11, pp. 1845-1853, (2009); Soldatos, John K., Convergence of utility computing with the Internet-of-things, pp. 874-879, (2012); Khan, Majid Iqbal, In-network storage model for data persistence under congestion in wireless sensor network, pp. 221-226, (2007); Xiang, Guofu, Virtualization-based security monitoring, Ruan Jian Xue Bao/Journal of Software, 23, 8, pp. 2173-2187, (2012); Balamurugan, Venkatachalam, Enhanced intrusion detection and prevention system on cloud environment using hybrid classification and OTS generation, Cluster Computing, 22, pp. 13027-13039, (2019); IEEE Trans Services Comput; Garg, Sahil, SDN-Based Secure and Privacy-Preserving Scheme for Vehicular Networks: A 5G Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 68, 9, pp. 8421-8434, (2019); Hu, Jiankun, A simple and efficient hidden Markov model scheme for host-based anomaly intrusion detection, IEEE Network, 23, 1, pp. 42-47, (2009)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083325241"

However, there are still problems of lower Pareto selection pressure and insufficient diversity maintenance mechanism. To address these problems, NSGAIII algorithm with maximum ranking strategy (NSGAIII-MR) is proposed. In this algorithm, the convergence and diversity distance are balanced by adaptive parameter settings to achieve better performance. The maximum ranking strategy exploits the perpendicular distance from the solution to the weight vector to increase Pareto selection pressure. Moreover, the diversity of population is maintained with the reference point strategy to guide the solutions closer to the real Pareto front. Comparing with NSGAIII, the NSGAIII-MR algorithm enhances selection pressure and has good convergence and diversity performance. Also, the performance of algorithm is verified by comparing with other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms on the benchmark problems and the NSGAIII-MR is competitive. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Diversity; Many-objective evolution algorithm; Maximum ranking strategy","Benchmarking; Adaptive parameter setting; Convergence; Diversity; Diversity of populations; Evolution algorithms; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Performance of algorithm; Ranking strategy; Genetic algorithms","","","This paper is supported by Major Project of Beijing Wuzi University (2019XJZD11), Beijing Intelligent Logistics System Collaborative Innovation Center Open Topic (No. BILSCIC-2019KF-05), Youth Fund Project of Beijing Wuzi University(No.2018XJQN03),General Program of Science and Technology Development Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission of China (No. KM201810037002), Grass-roots Academic Team Building Project of Beijing Wuzi University (No. 2019XJJCTD04), Beijing Youth Top-notch Talent Plan of High-Creation Plan (No. 2017000026833ZK25), Canal Plan-Leading Talent Project of Beijing Tongzhou District (No. YHLB2017038), National Natural Science Foundation of China (61803035, 71831001).","Arloff, William, A parameter estimation method for stiff ordinary differential equations using particle swarm optimisation, International Journal of Computing Science and Mathematics, 9, 5, pp. 419-432, (2018); Bader, Johannes, HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 45-76, (2011); Bi, Xiaojun, A niche-elimination operation based NSGA-III algorithm for many-objective optimization, Applied Intelligence, 48, 1, pp. 118-141, (2018); Bosman, Peter A.N., The balance between proximity and diversity in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 7, 2, pp. 174-188, (2003); Cai, Xingjuan, Improved bat algorithm with optimal forage strategy and random disturbance strategy, International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation, 8, 4, pp. 205-214, (2016); Cai, Xingjuan, Multi-objective three-dimensional DV-Hop localization algorithm with NSGA-II, IEEE Sensors Journal, 19, 21, pp. 10003-10015, (2019); Cai, Xingjuan, An ensemble bat algorithm for large-scale optimization, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 10, 11, pp. 3099-3113, (2019); Cai, Xingjuan, An under-sampled software defect prediction method based on hybrid multi-objective cuckoo search, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 32, 5, (2020); Cheng, Jixiang, A Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Enhanced Mating and Environmental Selections, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 4, pp. 592-605, (2015); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016)","","Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","","","","","","17580366; 17580374","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082187739"

Therefore, according to the different processing states and the physical degradation phenomena of the machine, this paper proposes an accurate maintenance (AM) model based on reliability intervals, which have different maintenance activities in diverse intervals and overcome the shortcoming of the single reliability threshold maintenance model used in the past. Combining the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), an integrated multiobjective optimization model is established with production scheduling and accurate maintenance. To strengthen the ability of the evolutionary algorithm to solve the presented model/problem, we propose a novel genetic algorithm, named the approximate nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (ANSGA-III), which is inspired by NSGA-III. To improve the performance of the Pareto dominance principle, the local search, the elite storage for the original algorithm, the approximate dominance principle, the variable neighborhood search, and the elite preservation strategy are proposed. Then, we employ a scheduling example to verify and evaluate the availability of the above three improved operations and the proposed algorithm. Next, we compare ANSGA-III against five recently proposed algorithms, representing the state-of-the-art on similar problems. Finally, we apply ANSGA-III to solve the integrated optimization model, and the results reveal that the machine can maintain higher availability and reliability when compared to other models in our experiments. Consequently, the superiority of the proposed model based on accurate maintenance of reliability intervals is demonstrated, and the optimal reliability threshold between the yellow and red areas is found to be 0.82. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accurate maintenance; ANSGA-III; Integrated optimization; Production scheduling; Reliability intervals","Genetic algorithms; Job shop scheduling; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Production control; Reliability; Scheduling; ANSGA-III; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Integrated optimization; Integrated optimization models; Multi-objective optimization models; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Production Scheduling; Variable neighborhood search; Preventive maintenance","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers whose comments helped considerably in improving this paper.

This drawback has resulted in difficulties in the deployment of MOEAs for multi-objective, large-scale optimization problems. Among different evolutionary algorithms, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-the third version (NSGA-III) is a fairly new method capable of solving large-scale optimization problems with acceptable computational requirements. In this paper, the performance of three crossover operators of the NSGA-III algorithm is benchmarked using a large-scale optimization problem based on human electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing. The studied operators are simulated binary (SBX), uniform crossover (UC), and single point (SI) crossovers. Furthermore, enhanced versions of the NSGA-III algorithm are proposed through introducing the concept of Stud and designing several improved crossover operators of SBX, UC, and SI. The performance of the proposed NSGA-III variants is verified on six large-scale optimization problems. Experimental results indicate that the NSGA-III methods with UC and UC-Stud (UCS) outperform the other developed variants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big data optimization; Crossover operator; Electroencephalography; Evolutionary multi-objective optimization; Large-scale optimization; NSGA-III; Performance analysis","Big data; Data handling; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Genetic algorithms; Interactive computer systems; Signal processing; Studs (fasteners); Studs (structural members); Crossover operator; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Large-scale optimization; NSGA-III; Performance analysis; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFB0901900), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61503165, No. 41576011, No. 61773120, No. 41706010, and No. 61873328), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20150239), and National Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (No. 61525304).","Abbass, Hussein A., Calibrating independent component analysis with laplacian reference for real-time EEG artifact removal, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8836, pp. 68-75, (2014); Chen, Xu, HIB-tree: An efficient index method for the big data analytics of large-scale human activity trajectories, Future Generation Computer Systems, 86, pp. 1269-1278, (2018); Cui, Zhihua, A novel oriented cuckoo search algorithm to improve DV-Hop performance for cyber–physical systems, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 103, pp. 42-52, (2017); Daneshmand, Amir, Hybrid Random/Deterministic Parallel Algorithms for Convex and Nonconvex Big Data Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 63, 15, pp. 3914-3929, (2015); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998); Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Facchinei, Francisco, Parallel selective algorithms for nonconvex big data optimization, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 63, 7, pp. 1874-1889, (2015); Ge, Hongwei, Cooperative Hierarchical PSO with Two Stage Variable Interaction Reconstruction for Large Scale Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 47, 9, pp. 2809-2823, (2017)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055637462"

However, the placement of such sensors in a water distribution network (WDN) has become a foremost concern around the world. In this paper, we first analyze sensor placement mathematically and prove that it is NP-hard. Subsequently, we distinguish between single- and multi-objective optimization, and attempt, for the first time, to propose a modified NSGA-III to solve many-objective optimization for the sensor placement problem.

Many renewable and non-renewable energy resources like photovoltaic system (PV), micro-turbine (MT), fuel cell (FC), and wind turbine system (WT) are incorporated in a grid-connected hybrid power system to supply energy demand. The main aim of this article is to maximize environmental, technical, and economic benefits by minimizing various objective functions such as the annual cost, power loss and greenhouse gas emission subject to different power system constraints and uncertainty of renewable energy sources. For each load model, optimum DER size and its corresponding location are calculated. To test the feasibility and validation of the multi-objective water cycle algorithm (MOWCA) is conducted on the IEEE-33 bus and IEEE-69 bus network. The concept of Pareto-optimality is applied to generate trilateral surface of non-dominant Pareto-optimal set followed by a fuzzy decision-making mechanism to obtain the final compromise solution.

However, assigning workflow tasks to nodes in the process of multi-node collaboration is still a challenge, because there are some unpredictable emergencies, i.e., uncertainty, in the process of workflow scheduling. The paper proposes a blockchain-powered resource provisioning (BPRP) method to solve the above problems. Technically, we use the directed acyclic graph in the graph theory to represent the workflow task and optimize the workflow scheduling strategy in the presence of uncertainty.

However, there are other important conflicting objectives that hinder the process of efficient network design. This study proposes a multi-objective optimization model for reliable communication flow networks, including maximizing the network reliability, minimizing total cost, and maximizing network flow, simultaneously. The total cost comprises the cost of construction of network arcs and the cost of flow, while arcs may fail to operate in full-capacity and may only function to a fraction of their capacity. The reliability-based network-design is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming and solved by three metaheuristic multi-objective methods namely multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and two versions of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (i.e., NSGA-II and NSGA-III). In order to select the best compromise solution from the Pareto front members, a fuzzy-based mechanism is utilized. Finally, in order to measure the performance of the three algorithms, several numerical examples in small and large-scale are solved. The computational results indicate that NSGA-III is superior to MOPSO and NSGA-II in terms of convergence rate and running time especially for large-scale problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Generalized flow network; MOPSO; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Reliability; Reliable network design","Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reliability; Screening; Flow network; Mixed integer linear programming; MOPSO; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Multi-objective optimization models; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-III; Reliable Networks; Multiobjective optimization","","","","International Journal of Industrial Engineering Production Research, (2013); Azghandi, Rana, Minimization of Drug Shortages in Pharmaceutical Supply Chains: A Simulation-Based Analysis of Drug Recall Patterns and Inventory Policies, Complexity, 2018, (2018); Bagherinejad, Jafar, Optimising the bi-objective multidimensional integer knapsack problem using non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimisation, International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering, 23, 3, pp. 263-289, (2016); Beltran, Fernando, On minimum cost isolated failure immune networks, Telecommunication Systems, 3, 2, pp. 183-200, (1994); High Performance Algorithms and Software for Nonlinear Optimization, (2003); Bhesdadiya, Rajnikant H., An NSGA-III algorithm for solving multi-objective economic/environmental dispatch problem, Cogent Engineering, 3, 1, (2016); IEEE Transactions on Reliability, (2019); Chen, Xuegang, A novel reliability estimation method of complex network based on Monte Carlo, Cluster Computing, 20, 2, pp. 1063-1073, (2017); Campos Ciro, Guillermo, A NSGA-II and NSGA-III comparison for solving an open shop scheduling problem with resource constraints, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, 12, pp. 1272-1277, (2016); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073067602"

One of the key issues in the management of virtual data center (VDC) is VDC embedding, which deals with the efficient mapping of required virtual network resources from the shared resources of the infrastructure provider (InP). In this paper, we propose a new VDC embedding algorithm that is different from previous works in many aspects. First, the provision of robustness for data center infrastructure is one of the critical requirements of cloud technology; however, this challenge has not been considered in the related literature. In order to analyze and evaluate the robustness of the infrastructure network, the classical and spectral graph robustness metrics are employed. Second, in order to avoid imbalance mapping and increase the efficiency of infrastructure resources, besides the resource dynamic capacity, four node attributes are exploited to compute the nodes mapping potential. The TOPSIS technique for nodes ranking has been used to increase the compatibility with the ideal solution. Third, unlike previous works in which the mapping phases of nodes and links are getting used to being separated, in the proposed algorithm, the virtual network is mapped to a physical network in a single step. Fourth, we also consider resources for network nodes (switches or routers). For these purposes, a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem is extracted with two goals of maximizing infrastructure network robustness and minimizing the long-term average cost-to-revenue ratio mapping for InPs. Finally, a new single-stage (non-dominated sorting-based genetic algorithm) NSGAII-based online VDCE algorithm is presented, where node mapping is TOP-MANR based and edge mapping is based on the shortest path. The fat-tree topology is considered for the substrate and virtual networks, and these two networks are modeled as a weighted undirected graph. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data center network virtualization; Network robustness; NSGAII; Optimization; TOPSIS; Virtual data center network (VDC); Virtual network embedding algorithm (VNE)","Distributed computer systems; Embeddings; Genetic algorithms; III-V semiconductors; Indium phosphide; Mapping; Optimization; Semiconducting indium phosphide; Topology; Trees (mathematics); Virtual reality; Virtualization; Data center networks; Network robustness; NSGA-II; TOPSIS; Virtual data centers; Virtual network embedding; Information management","","","","Zhang, Qi, Venice: Reliable virtual data center embedding in clouds, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 289-297, (2014); Gilesh, Malayamparambath, Towards a Complete Virtual Data Center Embedding Algorithm Using Hybrid Strategy, Proceedings - International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, pp. 2616-2617, (2017); Downtime Outages and Failures Understanding their True Costs, (2019); Tizghadam, Ali, On robust traffic engineering in core networks, pp. 2372-2377, (2008); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Np Completeness and Inapproximability of the Virtual Network Embedding Problem and Its Variants, (2018); Zheng, Xiangwei, A heuristic survivable virtual network mapping algorithm, Soft Computing, 23, 5, pp. 1453-1463, (2019); Zhani, Mohamed Faten, VDC Planner: Dynamic migration-aware Virtual Data Center embedding for clouds, pp. 18-25, (2013); Bianchi, Francesco, A markov reward based resource-latency aware heuristic for the virtual network embedding problem, Performance Evaluation Review, 44, 4, pp. 57-68, (2017); Amokrane, Ahmed, Greenhead: Virtual data center embedding across distributed infrastructures, IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, 1, 1, pp. 36-49, (2013)","","Springer","","","","","","15730484; 09208542","","JOSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072042309"

However, the explosive growth of meteorological data resources has brought new challenges to the placement and management of big data in MCP. On the one hand, managers of MCP need to save energy to achieve cost savings. On the other hand, users need shorter data access time to improve user’s experience. Hence, a big data placement method in MCP is proposed in this paper to deal with challenges above. First, the resource utilization, the data access time, and the energy consumption in MCP with the fat-tree topology are analyzed.

Such knowledge is extremely important for the purpose of designing bioinspired sensors and artificial retinal systems that will, in so far as may be possible, be capable of mimicking vertebrate retinal behaviour. In this study, we report the tuning of a reliable computational bioinspired retinal model with various algorithms to improve the mimicry of the model. Its main contribution is two-fold. First, given the multi-objective nature of the problem, an automatic multi-objective optimisation strategy is proposed through the use of four biological-based metrics, which are used to adjust the retinal model for accurate prediction of retinal ganglion cell responses. Second, a subset of population-based search heuristics—genetic algorithms (SPEA2, NSGA-II and NSGA-III), particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and differential evolution (DE)—are explored to identify the best algorithm for fine-tuning the retinal model, by comparing performance across a hypervolume metric. Nonparametric statistical tests are used to perform a rigorous comparison between all the metaheuristics. The best results were achieved with the PSO algorithm on the basis of the largest hypervolume that was achieved, well-distributed elements and high numbers on the Pareto front. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary computation; Multi-objective optimisation; Neural coding; Neural prosthesis; Population-based metaheuristic; Retinal modelling; Swarm intelligence","Biology; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Neural prostheses; Ophthalmology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Differential Evolution; Distributed elements; Meta-heuristic optimisation; Metaheuristic; Neural coding; Non-parametric statistical tests; Particle swarm optimisation; Retinal ganglion cells; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; animal; benchmarking; biological model; computer simulation; heuristics; physiology; procedures; retina; vertebrate; Algorithms; Animals; Benchmarking; Computer Simulation; Heuristics; Models, Biological; Retina; Vertebrates","","","Author Contributions: Conceptualisation, R.C.-C. and A.M.-Á.; methodology, R.C.-C. and A.M.-Á.; software, R.C.-C.; data curation, E.F.; investigation, R.C.-C.; writing—original draft preparation, R.C.-C.; writing—review and editing, R.C.-C., S.C.-A., E.F. and A.M.-Á.; funding acquisition, E.F.; supervision, A.M.-Á.; Funding: This work has been supported in part by the Spanish National Research Program (MAT2015-69967-C3-1), by Research Chair Bidons Egara and by a research grant of the Spanish Blind Organisation (ONCE).","Visual Impairment and Blindness, (2011); Mills, J.

The main reason for EMO's success is that the population-based EMO operators are able to establish an implicit parallel search within an evolving population to find multiple Pareto-optimal regions of the search space parallelly. For many-objective optimization problems involving a largedimensional objective space, the extent of implicit parallelism is argued here to be too generic, compared to the same in a lower-dimensional objective space. Decomposition-based EMO algorithms- A recent trend in EMO literature-which divide the overall computing task into a number of sub-tasks of focusing within a region of the search space have found to be successful in solving many-objective problems. In this paper, we study the effect of explicit control of an algorithm's implicit parallelism mechanism for achieving an enhanced performance of decomposition-based EMO algorithms. We consider three decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms (EAs)-MOEA/D, MOEA/D-M2M, and NSGA-III-for this purpose. We also investigate another explicit control strategy of suitably choosing a normalization method of objectives for improving the performance of MOEA/D and MOEA/D-M2M methods, and report much improved performance than their original counterparts. The principles of this study are valid for any population-based search and optimization algorithms and can be extended to improve the performance other single-objective EA, EMO, and other relevant CI methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Control strategies; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Implicit parallelisms; Many-objective optimizations; Normalization methods; Optimization algorithms; Research and application; Evolutionary algorithms","","","Funding text 1: The visit of the first author to Michigan State University was supported by China Scholarship Council.

Current forecasting models based on combined models theory could adapt to some time series data and overcome some disadvantages of the single models. However, in previous studies, most forecasting models have just focused on improving the accuracy or stability. Nevertheless, for an effective forecasting model, considering only one criterion or rule (stability or accuracy) is insufficient. In this paper, a novel forecasting system, called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III combined system with three objective functions, was proposed and successfully employed to solve the predicament of electricity load forecasting which demands to obtain both high accuracy and strong stability as an example. Both stability and accuracy of our proposed combined system are superior to the model compared which showed in the experiment results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined model; Multi-objective optimization; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III; Time series forecast","Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Sorting; System stability; Time series; Combined model; Electricity load forecasting; Forecasting modeling; Forecasting models; Forecasting system; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective functions; Time series forecasts; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 41475013.","Abdel-Aal, Radwan E., Modelling and forecasting monthly electric energy consumption in eastern Saudi Arabia using abductive networks, Energy, 22, 9, pp. 911-921, (1997); Al-Hamadi, Helal Mohamed, Long-term/mid-term electric load forecasting based on short-term correlation and annual growth, Electric Power Systems Research, 74, 3, pp. 353-361, (2005); Al-Janabi, Samaher, Pragmatic miner to risk analysis for intrusion detection (PMRA-ID), Communications in Computer and Information Science, 788, pp. 263-277, (2017); Al-Janabi, Samaher, Smart system to create an optimal higher education environment using IDA and IOTs, International Journal of Computers and Applications, 42, 3, pp. 244-259, (2020); Al-Janabi, Samaher, Soft Mathematical System to Solve Black Box Problem through Development the FARB Based on Hyperbolic and Polynomial Functions, Proceedings - International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE, pp. 37-42, (2017); Al-Janabi, Samaher, Design and evaluation of a hybrid system for detection and prediction of faults in electrical transformers, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 67, pp. 324-335, (2015); Al-Janabi, Samaher, Assessing the suitability of soft computing approaches for forest fires prediction, Applied Computing and Informatics, 14, 2, pp. 214-224, (2018); Amral, N., Short term load forecasting using multiple linear regression, pp. 1192-1198, (2007); Bates Jm, COMBINATION OF FORECASTS, Operational Research Quarterly, 20, 4, pp. 451-468, (1969); Bunnoon, Pituk, Multi-substation control central load area forecasting by using HP-filter and double neural networks (HP-DNNs), International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 44, 1, pp. 561-570, (2013)","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","","","","","14327643; 14337479","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058382721"

Biomedical concepts are usually complex and ambiguous, which makes matching biomedical ontologies a challenge. Since none of the similarity measures can distinguish the heterogeneous biomedical concepts in any context independently, usually several similarity measures are applied together to determine the biomedical concepts mappings. However, the ignorance of the effects brought about by different biomedical concept mapping’s preference on the similarity measures significantly reduces the alignment’s quality. In this study, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-III-based biomedical ontology matching technique is proposed to effectively match the biomedical ontologies, which first utilises an ontology partitioning technique to transform the large-scale biomedical ontology matching problem into several ontology segment-matching problems, and then uses NSGA-III to determine the optimal alignment without tuning the aggregating weights. The experiment is conducted on the anatomy track and large biomedic ontologies track which are provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), and the comparisons with OAEI’s participants show the effectiveness of the authors’ approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Biomedical engineering; Genetic algorithms; Mapping; Medical information systems; Ontology; Scales (weighing instruments); Semantics; Biomedical information; Biomedical ontologies; Concepts mappings; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Ontology alignment evaluation initiative (OAEI); Optimal alignments; Partitioning techniques; Similarity measure; Bioinformatics","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61503082 and 61403121), the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (No. 2016J05145), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2015B20214), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian Province University (No. GY-Z18155), the Program for Outstanding Young Scientific Researcher in Fujian Province University (No. GY-Z160149) and the Scientific Research Foundation of Fujian University of Technology (No. GY-Z17162).","Description Logics, (2013); López-Fernández, Hugo, BioAnnote: A software platform for annotating biomedical documents with application in medical learning environments, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 111, 1, pp. 139-147, (2013); Isern, David, Ontology-driven execution of clinical guidelines, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 107, 2, pp. 122-139, (2012); de Potter, Pieterjan, Semantic patient information aggregation and medicinal decision support, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 108, 2, pp. 724-735, (2012); Harris, Midori A., The Gene Oncology (GO) database and informatics resource, Nucleic Acids Research, 32, DATABASE ISS., pp. D258-D261, (2004); Golbeck, Jennifer A., The National Cancer Institute's thésaurus and ontology, Journal of Web Semantics, 1, 1, pp. 75-80, (2003); Rosse, Cornelius, A reference ontology for biomedical informatics: The Foundational Model of Anatomy, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 36, 6, pp. 478-500, (2003); Schulz, Stefan, Consolidating SNOMED CT's ontological commitment, Applied Ontology, 6, 1, pp. 1-11, (2011); Heymans, Stijn, Semantic validation of the use of SNOMED CT in HL7 clinical documents, Journal of Biomedical Semantics, 2, 1, (2011); J Comput Sci Eng, (2013)","","Institution of Engineering and Technology jbristow@theiet.org","","","","","","24686557; 24682322","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073191758"

However, the convergence capability of NSGA-III is poor in many cases. In this paper, a new selection-and-elimination operator is designed to balance convergence and diversity. First, a selection operator is employed to identify the reference point with the minimum niche count, and then one individual with the shortest penalty-based boundary intersection distance is chosen. Second, a reference point with the maximum niche count is identified, and one individual with the longest penalty-based boundary intersection distance is removed by the elimination operator. To test performance, this modification is verified on benchmark problems with up to 15 objectives, and compared with five other state-of-the-art algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that our modified strategy can achieve the better performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Elimination operator; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Reference-point strategy; Selection operator","Genetic algorithms; Elimination operator; Many-objective optimizations; NSGA-III; Reference points; Selection operators; Benchmarking","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61806138 , No. U1636220 and No. 61663028 , Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province under Grant No. 201801D121127 , PhD Research Startup Foundation of Taiyuan University of Science and Technology under Grant No. 20182002 .","Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, (2001); Zitzler, Eckart, Indicator-based selection in multiobjective search, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3242, pp. 832-842, (2004); Wang, Penghong, A multi-objective DV-hop localization algorithm based on NSGA-II in internet of things, Mathematics, 7, 2, (2019); Cui, Zhihua, Detection of Malicious Code Variants Based on Deep Learning, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14, 7, pp. 3187-3196, (2018); Biswas, Partha P., Decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for windfarm layout optimization, Renewable Energy, 115, pp. 326-337, (2018); Hadka, David M., An open source framework for many-objective robust decision making, Environmental Modelling and Software, 74, pp. 114-129, (2015); Masood, Atiya, Many-objective genetic programming for job-shop scheduling, pp. 209-216, (2016); Kasprzyk, Joseph R., Managing population and drought risks using many-objective water portfolio planning under uncertainty, Water Resources Research, 45, 12, (2009); Zhang, Jiangjiang, Privacy protection based on many-objective optimization algorithm, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 31, 20, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22106502","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067231671"

In this kind of problems, we have two types of classes: the majority class and the minority one. The former has a relatively high number of instances while the latter contains a much less number of instances. As most traditional classifiers usually assume that data is evenly distributed for all classes, they may considerably fail in recognizing instances in the minority class due to the imbalance problem. Several interesting approaches have been proposed to handle the class imbalance issue in the literature and the Oblique Decision Tree (ODT) is one of them. Nevertheless, most standard ODT construction algorithms use a greedy search process; while only very few works have addressed this induction problem using an evolutionary approach and this is done without really considering the class imbalance issue. To cope with this limitation, we propose in this paper a multi-objective evolutionary approach to find optimized ODTs for imbalanced binary classification. Our approach, called ODT-Θ-NSGA-III (ODT-based-Θ-Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III), is motivated by its abilities: (a) to escape local optima in the ODT search space and (b) to maximize simultaneously both Precision and Recall. Thanks to these two features, ODT-Θ-NSGA-III provides competitive and better results when compared to many state-of-the-art classification algorithms on commonly used imbalanced benchmark data sets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithms; Imbalanced data binary classification; Multi-objective optimization; Oblique decision trees","Binary trees; Data mining; Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Trees (mathematics); Binary classification; Classification algorithm; Construction algorithms; Evolutionary approach; Multi-objective evolutionary; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Oblique decision tree; Precision and recall; Classification (of information)","","","","Enhancing Multi Class Classification of Random Forest Using Random Vector Functional Neural Network and Oblique Decision Surfaces, (2018); Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, (1994); López, Victoria Victoria, A hierarchical genetic fuzzy system based on genetic programming for addressing classification with highly imbalanced and borderline data-sets, Knowledge-Based Systems, 38, pp. 85-104, (2013); Jacques, Julie, Conception of a dominance-based multi-objective local search in the context of classification rule mining in large and imbalanced data sets, Applied Soft Computing, 34, pp. 705-720, (2015); Yen, Show Jane, Under-sampling approaches for improving prediction of the minority class in an imbalanced dataset, Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences, 344, pp. 731-740, (2006); García, Salvador, A proposal of evolutionary prototype selection for class imbalance problems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4224 LNCS, pp. 1415-1423, (2006); Sundarkumar, G.

This paper presents a novel many-objective population extremal optimization called MaOPEO-HM algorithm for MaOPs by introducing a reference set based many-objective optimization mechanism into a recently developed population extremal optimization framework and designing an adaptive hybrid mutation operation for updating the population. Despite of the successful applications of extremal optimization in different kinds of numerical and engineering optimization problems, it has never been explored to the many-objective optimization domain so far. Because most of the existing many-objective evolutionary algorithms are usually guided by a single mutation operation, which has insufficient ability to exploit the search space of MaOPs and will get stuck at any local efficient front, it is the first attempt to design a novel hybrid mutation scheme in MaOPEO-HM algorithm by combining the advantages of polynomial mutation operator and multi-non-uniform mutation operator effectively. The experiment results for DTLZ test problems with 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 objectives and WFG test problems with 3, 5, and 8 objectives have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed MaOPEO-HM to five state-of-the-art decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms including NSGA-III, RVEA, EFR-RR, θ-DEA, and MOEA/DD and two non-decomposition-based algorithms including GrEA and Two_Arch2. Furthermore, the great ability of the designed adaptive hybrid mutation operation incorporated into many-objective population extremal optimization (MaOPEO)has also been illustrated by comparing MaOPEO-HM and two MaOPEO algorithms only based on traditional multi-non-uniform mutation or polynomial mutation for DTLZ problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive hybrid mutation operation; Many-objective evolutionary algorithms; Many-objective optimization problems; Many-objective population extremal optimization","Optimization; Engineering optimization problems; Extremal optimization; Many-objective optimizations; Mutation operations; Non-uniform mutation; Polynomial mutation; Reference set; Single mutation; Evolutionary algorithms","","","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61373158, 61872153 and 61703309), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.

To solve the proposed model, an enhanced variant of Multi-Directional Local Search (EMDLS) is developed to approximate the Pareto frontier. The proposed method employs a Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) framework to find efficient solutions and update the approximated Pareto frontier at each iteration. The LNS algorithm makes use of three routing-oriented destroy operators and a construction heuristic based on a multi-round approach. The performance of EMDLS is compared to MDLS, an Improved MDLS (IMDLS), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGAIII), and the weighting and epsilon-constraint methods. Extensive experiments have been conducted using a set of instances generated from the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem benchmark tests in the literature. In addition, real data is utilised to estimate fixed and variable costs, CO <inf>2</inf> emissions, capacity, and the driving range of each type of vehicle. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method to find high-quality non-dominated solutions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electric vehicles; Multi-directional local search; Multi-objective; Multiple driving ranges; Routing","Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Local search (optimization); Number theory; Sorting; Vehicle routing; Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Driving range; Local search; Mixed integer linear programming model; Multi objective; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Routing; Fleet operations","","","This work has been partially supported by IÉSEG School of Management, the University of Portsmouth and the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.","Green Transportation Logistics, (2016); Bektaş, Tolga, The Pollution-Routing Problem, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 45, 8, pp. 1232-1250, (2011); Bezerra, Leonardo C.T., An empirical assessment of the properties of inverted generational distance on multi- and many-objective optimization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10173 LNCS, pp. 31-45, (2017); Browne, Michael J., Evaluating the use of an urban consolidation centre and electric vehicles in central London, IATSS Research, 35, 1, pp. 1-6, (2011); Bruglieri, Maurizio, A new Mathematical Programming Model for the Green Vehicle Routing Problem, Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics, 55, pp. 89-92, (2016); Bruglieri, Maurizio, A three-phase matheuristic for the time-effective electric vehicle routing problem with partial recharges, Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics, 58, pp. 95-102, (2017); Caballero, Rafael, Solving a multiobjective location routing problem with a metaheuristic based on tabu search.

This paper also considers learning rate and uncertainties in the activity durations. Design/methodology/approach: An activity schedule with requirements of different resource units is used to calculate the objectives: makespan and resource efficiency. A comparisons between non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm – II (NSGA-II) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm – III (NSGA-III) is done to calculate near optimal solutions. Buffers are introduced in the activity schedule to take uncertainty into account and learning rate is used to incorporate the learning effect. Findings: The results show that NSGA-III gives better near optimal solutions than NSGA-II for multi-objective problem with different complexities of activity schedule. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not considers activity sequencing with multiple activity relations (for instance partial overlapping among different activities) and dynamic events occurring in between or during activities. Practical implications: The paper helps project managers in manufacturing industry to schedule the activities and allocate resources for a near-real world environment. Originality/value: This paper takes into account both the learning rate and the uncertainties in the activity duration for a resource constrained project management problem. The uncertainty in both the individual durations of activities and the whole project duration time is taken into consideration.

This situation is known as Interpretability-Accuracy Trade-off. To handle this trade-off between accuracy and interpretability the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are often used to optimize the performance of the fuzzy classification system. From the last two decades, several multi-objective evolutionary systems have been designed and successfully implemented in several fields for finding multiple solutions at a single run. In Financial Decision making concerning Credit Allocation, Classification is a significant component to obtain credit scores and predict bankruptcy. A fuzzy classification system for the financial credit decision has been designed and find out the Accuracy and Interpretability parameters for applying various MOEAs to get the pareto optimal solution resulting in to improvement in the performance of the proposed system.

Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is one of the approaches that support software reuse by utilizing reusable software components. Many approaches have been proposed in the literature to mine reusable components from existing object-oriented software. But, almost all of these approaches are dependent on the selection of third-party application software as clients. Therefore, this paper proposes a reusable component identification approach from the source-code of a singular object-oriented software system especially related to multimedia tools. The proposed approach is based on making use of two kinds of dependency relations among different software elements namely structural and lexical relations. These relations, help us to measure cohesion at the component level using two proposed cohesion metrics. The cohesion values are further used as objective functions in the multi-objective search-based evolutionary algorithm, namely NSGA-III to identify the set of reusable components as different clusters. The proposed approach is validated by applying it to six open source Java applications of different sizes and belonging to multimedia domains. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Component identification; Lexical relations; Reusable; Structural relation","Application programs; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Reusability; Component identification; Component-based software engineering; Lexical relations; Object-oriented software systems; Reusable; Reusable software components; Structural relation; Third party application (Apps); Computer software reusability","","","","Adjoyan, Seza, Service identification based on quality metrics: Object-oriented legacy system migration towards SOA, Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, SEKE, 2014-January, January, pp. 1-6, (2014); Allen, Andrew A., A user-centric approach to dynamic adaptation of reusable communication services, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 20, 2, pp. 209-227, (2016); Allier, Simon, Restructuring object-oriented applications into component-oriented applications by using consistency with execution traces, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6092 LNCS, pp. 216-231, (2010); Allier, Simon, From object-oriented applications to component-oriented applications via component-oriented architecture, pp. 214-223, (2011); Al-Shara, Zakarea, Migrating large object-oriented applications into component-based ones instantiation and inheritance transformation, pp. 55-64, (2015); Amarjeet, Improving modular structure of software system using structural and lexical dependency, Information and Software Technology, 82, pp. 96-120, (2017); Jubair Basha, N.

Placement of reference points for many-objective optimization is inspired by wheel and Von Neumann topologies of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Results obtained show that the pattern of reference point placement determines performance efficiency of NSGA. The better-performing wheel topology (called wheel reference point genetic algorithm (wRPGA), is compared to three other many-objective evolutionary algorithms: knee-driven evolutionary algorithm (KnEA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGAIII) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on dominance and decomposition (MOEAD/D).

Through the simulations, the wheel configuration performed 88.9% better than the Von Neumann configuration.

When designing a product for consumers, designers should take into account multiple affective responses. Therefore, designing products that can satisfy multiple affective responses is a multi-objective optimization problem. In this article, a novel model based on the robust posterior preference articulation approach is proposed to optimize product form design by simultaneously considering multiple affective responses. First, design analysis is performed to determine design variables and affective responses. Subsequently, the Taguchi method is used, and the signal-to-noise ratios are calculated. Based on the results, predictive models for signal-to-noise ratios concerning multiple affective responses are built and then a multi-objective optimization model is constructed. The reference-point-based many-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm–II (called NSGA-III) is used to solve the multi-objective optimization model for obtaining Pareto solutions. Finally, a combination of the fuzzy Kano model and the fuzzy optimum selection model is adopted to select the optimal solution from the obtained Pareto solutions. A car profile design was employed to present the proposed approach.

Good quality software components are those components, which are internally strongly cohesive and are independent of others. Use of such components helps in faster development of a software and reduces the maintenance efforts in future. Such components can be identified from different software repositories and can be reused whenever needed. Hence, proper identification of such reusable components is a promising area of research, and the same has been targeted in this paper. This paper model Reusable Software Component Identification (RSCI) problem as a search-based multi-objective problem in order to identify optimized reusable software components from the object-oriented (OO) source code of a software system. For OO software paradigm, we consider the component as an individual class or group of connected classes which can be reused with least modifications. To identify this, three types of relationship are proposed in this paper, namely (1) Frequent Usage Pattern (FUP) based cohesion (2) semantic relatedness based cohesion and (3) co-change based coupling. The proposed approach optimizes by simultaneously maximizing both types of cohesion and minimizing the coupling of a given component. The FUP based cohesion maximization is based on the newly proposed cohesion metric called PatternCohesion which is computed using FUP information extracted from a given software element (class/ interface in an object-oriented language). The FUP of a class comprises of those member variables of all classes of the software, which are directly or indirectly accessed by member functions defined in the class under consideration. The PatternCohesion metric helps to measure the functional relatedness among different pairs of software elements (classes). The semantic relatedness based cohesion maximization is based on TF-IDF based Cosine Similarity measurement using tokens extracted from three main parts of the source code of a given software element namely class/ interface declaration statement, data types of different member variables and member function signatures. The co-change based coupling is computed from the change-history of the underlying software system using well-known data mining metric called Support. Finally, reusable components are identified as different cohesive groups (consisting of one or more connected classes) using NSGA-III Algorithm. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated over six open source software systems belonging to different domains. The need of considering all three types of relations is established by comparing their performance with relations taken individually and two at a time. The obtained results indicate a higher quality for different software components measured in terms of reusability characteristics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clustering; Component extraction; Component identification; Frequent Usage Patterns; Functional cohesion; Multi-Objective; Rank score; Search-Based Optimization; Software component","Codes (symbols); Computer software reusability; Data mining; Open source software; Open systems; Reusability; Semantics; Software design; Software quality; Clustering; Component extraction; Component identification; Functional cohesion; Multi objective; Rank scores; Search based optimizations; Software component; Usage patterns; Object oriented programming","","","","Wang, Xichen, Software reuse and distributed object technology, pp. 804-807, (2011); Component Software Beyond Object Oriented Programming, (2002); Birkmeier, Dominik Q., On component identification approaches - Classification, state of the art, and comparison, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5582 LNCS, pp. 1-18, (2009); Birkmeier, Dominik Q., A method to support a reflective derivation of business components from conceptual models, Information Systems and e-Business Management, 11, 3, pp. 403-435, (2013); Cai, Zhengong, Afuzzy formal concept analysis based approach for business component identification, Journal of Zhejiang University: Science C, 12, 9, pp. 707-720, (2011); Hossien Hasheminejad, Seyed Mohammad, CCIC: Clustering analysis classes to identify software components, Information and Software Technology, 57, 1, pp. 329-351, (2015); Mishra, Shivendu, Creating reusable software component from object-oriented legacy system through reverse engineering, Journal of Object Technology, 8, 5, pp. 133-152, (2009); Kebir, Selim, Quality-centric approach for software component identification from object-oriented code, pp. 181-190, (2012); Allier, Simon, From object-oriented applications to component-oriented applications via component-oriented architecture, pp. 214-223, (2011); Al-Shara, Zakarea, Migrating large object-oriented applications into component-based ones instantiation and inheritance transformation, pp. 55-64, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","26659182; 25901184","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065068228"

In order to mitigate conflicts between the resource limitation of mobile devices and users’ demands of decreasing processing latency as well as prolonging battery life, it spurs a popular wave of offloading mobile applications for execution to centralized and decentralized data centers, such as cloud and edge servers. Due to the complexity and difference of mobile big data, arbitrarily offloading the mobile applications poses a remarkable challenge to optimizing the execution time and the energy consumption for mobile devices, despite the improved performance of Internet of Things (IoT) in cloud-edge computing. To address this challenge, we propose a computation offloading method, named COM, for IoT-enabled cloud-edge computing. Specifically, a system model is investigated, including the execution time and energy consumption for mobile devices. Then dynamic schedules of data/control-constrained computing tasks are confirmed. In addition, NSGA-III (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III) is employed to address the multi-objective optimization problem of task offloading in cloud-edge computing. Finally, systematic experiments and comprehensive simulations are conducted to corroborate the efficiency of our proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big data; Cloud-edge computing; Computation offloading; Energy consumption; IoT","Big data; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Green computing; Mobile computing; Multiobjective optimization; Computation offloading; Decentralized data centers; Internet of Things (IOT); Mobile applications; Multi-objective optimization problem; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Resource limitations; Systematic experiment; Internet of things","","","This research is supported by the National Science Foundation of China under grant no. 61702277 , no. 61872219 , no. 6177228 and no. 616722763 .

Most existing evolutionary multi-or many-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have utilized two factors: 1) domination and 2) crowding levels of each solution. Although these two coarse-grained factors are found to be adequate in many EMO algorithms, their relative importance in an algorithm has been a matter of great concern to many current studies. We argue that beside these issues, other more fine-grained factors are of importance. For example, since extreme objective-wise solutions are important in establishing a noise-free and stable normalization process, reaching extreme solutions is more crucial than finding other solutions. In this paper, we propose an integrated algorithm, B-NSGA-III, that produces much better convergence and diversity preservation. For this purpose, in addition to emphasizing extreme objective-wise solutions, B-NSGA-III tries to find solutions near intermediate undiscovered regions of the front. B-NSGA-III addresses critical algorithmic issues of convergence and diversity-preservation directly through recent progresses in literature and integrates all these critical fine-grained factors seamlessly in an alternating phases scheme. The proposed algorithm is shown to perform better than a number of commonly used existing methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker proximity metric (KKTPM); local search (LS); multiobjective; optimization","Aggregates; Measurement; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Statistics; Convergence; Evolutionary; KKTPM; Local search; Multi objective; Search problem; Sociology; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, (1985); Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Controlled elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms for better convergence, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1993, pp. 67-81, (2001); Bosman, Peter A.N., The balance between proximity and diversity in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 7, 2, pp. 174-188, (2003); Tan, Kay Chen, Balancing exploration and exploitation with adaptive variation for evolutionary multi-objective optimization, European Journal of Operational Research, 197, 2, pp. 701-713, (2009); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Jain, Himanshu, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point based nondominated sorting approach, Part II: Handling constraints and extending to an adaptive approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 602-622, (2014); Seada, Haitham Ahmed, A Unified Evolutionary Optimization Procedure for Single, Multiple, and Many Objectives, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 3, pp. 358-359, (2016); Li, Ke, Stable matching-based selection in evolutionary multiobjective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 6, pp. 909-923, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053622922"

However, literature severely lacks formal mathematical analysis to establish the reason behind superior performance of such methods. In this work, the neighborhood property of the many-objective optimization problems is recognized and is used to propose the neighborhood-sensitive archived evolutionary many-objective optimization (NAEMO) algorithm. In NAEMO, mating occurs within a local neighborhood and every reference direction continues to retain at least one associated candidate solution. Such preservation of candidate solutions leads to a monotonic improvement in diversity which has been theoretically and experimentally studied. Moreover, to combine the advantages of various mutation strategies, probabilistic mutation switching concept is introduced and to keep the archive size under control, periodic filtering modules are integrated with the NAEMO framework. Experimental results reveal that, in terms of inverted generational distance, hypervolume values and purity metric, NAEMO outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms viz. NSGA-III, MOEA/D, θ-DEA, MOEA/DD, GrEA, HypE, MOPSO and dMOPSO on DTLZ1-4 test problems for up to 15 objectives. Further experiments show that NAEMO is competitive to M2M-based algorithms where the difficult regions of IMB problems have also been explored. These experiments make NAEMO a robust algorithm, which is additionally supported by theoretical foundations.

The other is to ensure quick convergence to the optimal solution set. In this paper, we propose a novel two-archive strategy for evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm. The uniform archive strategy, based on reference points, is used to keep population diversity in the evolutionary process, and to ensure that an evolutionary algorithm is able to search the entire solution space. The single elite archive strategy is used to ensure that individuals with the best single objective value are able to evolve into the next generation and have more opportunities to generate offspring. This strategy aims to improve the convergence rate. Then this novel two-archive strategy is applied to improving the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III).

To measure the performance of EMO algorithms, many benchmark multiobjective test problems have been constructed. Among them, DTLZ and WFG are two representative test suites with the scalability to the number of variables and objectives. It should be pointed out that MaOPs can be more challenging if they are involved with difficult problem features, such as objective scalability, complicated Pareto set, bias, disconnection, or degeneracy. In this paper, a set of ten new test problems with above-mentioned difficulties are constructed. Some experimental results on these test problems found by two popular EMO algorithms, i.e., MOEA/D and NSGA-III, are reported and analyzed.

As the prosumers are equipped with smart appliances, photovoltaic panels, and battery energy storage systems, they take advantage of their consumption, generation, and storage flexibilities to exchange energy with neighboring prosumers through negotiating on the amount of energy and its price with an aggregator. The proposed framework comprises two separate multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization models for prosumers and the aggregator. Prosumers' objective is to maximize the comfort level and minimize the electricity cost at each instant of time, while aggregator intends to maximize its profit and minimize the grid burden by matching prosumers' supply and demand. The evolutionary nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is employed to generate a set of feasible nondominated solutions to the optimization problem of each individual prosumer and the aggregator. As a bilateral negotiation between each prosumer and the aggregator results in significant computational and communication overhead, a virtual power plant is introduced as an intermediator on behalf of all prosumers to proceed the negotiation with the aggregator in a privacy-preserving noncooperative environment, where no private information is shared. Hence, an automated negotiation approach is embedded in the framework, which enables the negotiators to reactively negotiate on concurrent power and price using private utility functions and preferences. To converge to an acceptable agreement, the negotiation approach follows an alternating-offer production protocol and a reactive utility value concession strategy. The effectiveness of the framework is evaluated by several economic and environmental assessment metrics through a variety of numerical simulations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distributed coordination; energy negotiation; multi-objective optimization; pricing; prosumers; smart grid","Cooperative communication; Costs; Data privacy; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Distributed coordination; energy negotiation; Indexes; Informatics; Load modeling; Prosumers; Smart grid; Smart power grids","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the European Union FP7 program under Grant 619560 (SEMIAH).; Funding text 2: Manuscript received March 30, 2018; revised July 30, 2018; accepted August 16, 2018.

First, the industrial production process was analyzed to extract key factors that affect furnace temperature and combine them with the SVR algorithm to establish a prediction model for furnace temperature. Then, a multi-objective optimization constraint set and optimization objective function were constructed based on the constraints of the production process and equipment conditions. Finally, based on the prediction model, the constraint set, and the objective function, a multi-objective optimization algorithm was employed to optimize section gas based on the NSGA-III. The experimental verification and production results demonstrate that a model constructed using actual collected data yields excellent prediction results. When the multi-objective optimization method was implemented and put into production, the steel coil over-temperature alarm ratio was reduced and the average over-temperature alarm time was greatly reduced. The proposed method improves the production environment and ensures that the procss is safe and stable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous annealing process; Multiobjective optimization; NSGA-III; SVR","Annealing; Forecasting; Furnaces; Gases; Heat treating furnaces; Temperature; Continuous annealing process; Equipment conditions; Experimental verification; Furnace temperatures; Industrial production; NSGA-III; Optimization objective function; Production environments; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61773354), the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2015CFA010), and the 111 project (Grant No. B17040).","Liu, Haitao, Effects of rolling temperature on microstructure, texture, formability and magnetic properties in strip casting Fe-6.5 wt% Si non-oriented electrical steel, Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, 391, pp. 65-74, (2015); Wang, Xianpeng, Multi-objective operation optimization of continuous production process with safety constraints, Kongzhi yu Juece/Control and Decision, 33, 10, pp. 1740-1746, (2018); Wang, Rui, Comprehensive optimisation technology of roller profile in continuous annealing furnace, Ironmaking and Steelmaking, 45, 6, pp. 519-522, (2018); Zhang, Yongyue, Subspace modeling method for burn-through point, Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics, 20, 2, pp. 279-286, (2016); Wu, Hai, Non-linear model predictive control of throughput and strip temperature for continuous annealing line, Ironmaking and Steelmaking, 42, 8, pp. 570-578, (2015); Giagkiozis, Ioannis, An overview of population-based algorithms for multi-objective optimisation, International Journal of Systems Science, 46, 9, pp. 1572-1599, (2015); Liu, Linzhong, Generic constraints handling techniques in constrained multi-criteria optimization and its application, European Journal of Operational Research, 244, 2, pp. 576-591, (2015); Feng, Zhongkai, Multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization for economic environmental hydrothermal energy system scheduling, Energy, 131, pp. 165-178, (2017); Kong, Weijian, A real-time multiobjective electric energy allocation optimization approach for the smelting process of magnesia, Zidonghua Xuebao/Acta Automatica Sinica, 40, 1, pp. 51-61, (2014); Peralta, Richard C., Multiobjective genetic algorithm conjunctive use optimization for production, cost, and energy with dynamic return flow, Journal of Hydrology, 511, pp. 776-785, (2014)","","Fuji Technology Press jaciii@fujipress.jp","","","","","","13430130; 18838014","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063801738"

In order to accomplish numerous agricultural tasks, the order in which the crop is covered is particularly important in order to minimise travelling cost and to preserve soil conditions. However, it is difficult to determine an optimised sequential path for the robot which minimizes navigation costs, while ensuring a fully completed agricultural operation. This paper presents the implementation of a multi-objective algorithm to solve the path planning problem for pesticide spraying operation inside a greenhouse. Pesticide spraying problems found in greenhouses have been adapted from the vehicle routing problem found in operations research, where the infected plants represent the customers and the mobile robot represents the vehicles. Routes between the plants are generated using a Probabilistic Roadmap path planner based on the designed virtual environment. The virtual environment is designed based on the real greenhouse environment to visualise the agricultural operation inside the greenhouse. To determine the best routes for the mobile robot, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm using Reference Point Based (NSGA-III) is tested and applied to the system. The solution quality has been compared with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) using the C-metric indicator. Comparisons with NSGA-II using the C-metric indicator verify that NSGA-III offers a superior performance with a good quality result. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural operation; Mobile robot; Multi-objective; Navigation","Agriculture; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouses; Motion planning; Navigation; Operations research; Pesticides; Vehicle routing; Virtual reality; Agricultural operations; Greenhouse environment; Multi objective; Multi objective algorithm; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Path planning problems; Vehicle Routing Problems; Mobile robots; genetic algorithm; greenhouse ecosystem; multiobjective programming; navigation; routing","","","The authors are grateful to the Ainuddin Wahid Scholarship and to the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for their partial financial support through their research funds, Vote No. R.J130000.2523.19H29 .","Quarterly of Applied Mathematics, (1958); Chen, Chen, An Improved NSGA-III Algorithm for Reservoir Flood Control Operation, Water Resources Management, 31, 14, pp. 4469-4483, (2017); undefined, (2001); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Páez, Francisco C., Implementation of a low-cost crop detection prototype for selective spraying in greenhouses, Precision Agriculture, 18, 6, pp. 1011-1023, (2017); Wcci 2012 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence 2012, (2012); Conesa-Muñoz, J., Route planning for agricultural tasks: A general approach for fleets of autonomous vehicles in site-specific herbicide applications, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 127, pp. 204-220, (2016); Sethanan, Kanchana, Multi-objective particle swarm optimization for mechanical harvester route planning of sugarcane field operations, European Journal of Operational Research, 252, 3, pp. 969-984, (2016); Paice, M.

These production lines usually produce mixed model products in lots which can improve the production efficiency and satisfy the different customer's demand. However, it is very challenging for factory planners to make decision on the optimal size of lots for each product model in production lines. Therefore, current research investigates lotsizing and mixed model scheduling problem in flexible parallel production lines considering sequence dependent setup times between mixed model products with aims to minimize makespan of production lines, balance the workload among lines and maximize the net profit, simultaneously. Additionally, a new constraint of material availability is introduced to the problem. A novel Pareto based guided artificial bee colony algorithm (PGABC) with three different guided mechanisms is designed for the current problem to obtain near optimal Pareto solutions. Taguchi method is adopted to tune the effective parameters of the proposed PGABC algorithm. Furthermore, nine different sets of instances including 90 problems are generated and tested using PGABC. The performance of PGABC is compared with other three famous methods used for multi objective optimization in literature including, multi objective artificial bee colony algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGAIII) and improved strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2). Computational results indicate that proposed PGABC outperforms the other considered algorithms both in terms of solution diversity and quality based on the considered test problem instances. Finally, an industrial case problem from a bus and coach company is solved by the proposed approach for mixed-model lotsizing and scheduling in parallel production lines. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Lotsizing; Mixed model; Multi-objectives; Sequence dependent setup; Taguchi method","Customer satisfaction; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Taguchi methods; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Lot sizing; Mixed modeling; Multi objective; Sequence dependent setups; Scheduling","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the very constructive comments and suggestions of anonymous referees and editor.

One of the obstacles that may limit the adaptation of new metamodels by developers is the extensive manual changes that have been applied to migrate existing models. Recent studies addressed the problem of automating the metamodel/model co-evolution based on manually defined migration rules. The definition of these rules requires the list of changes at the metamodel level which are difficult to fully identify. Furthermore, different possible alternatives may be available to translate a metamodel change to a model change. Thus, it is hard to generalize these co-evolution rules. Objective: We propose an alternative automated approach for the metamodel/model co-evolution. The proposed approach refines an initial model instantiated from the previous metamodel version to make it as conformant as possible to the new metamodel version by finding the best compromise between three objectives, namely minimizing (i) the non-conformities with new metamodel version, (ii) the changes to existing models, and (iii) the textual and structural dissimilarities between the initial and revised models. Method: We formulated the metamodel/model co-evolution as a multi-objective optimization problem to handle the different conflicting objectives using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Results: We evaluated our approach on several evolution scenarios extracted from different widely used metamodels. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach with average manual correctness, precision and recall respectively higher than 91%, 88% and 89% on the different co-evolution scenarios. Conclusion: A comparison with our previous work confirms the out-performance of our multi-objective formulation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coupled evolution; Metamodel/model co-evolution; Model migration; Search based software engineering","Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Screening; Software engineering; Co-evolution; Coupled evolution; Model migrations; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Multi-objective formulation; Multi-objective optimization problem; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Search-based software engineering; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work has been partially funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development, and by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) P 28519-N31, and by the Canada NSERC grant RGPIN/06702-2014.","Model Driven Software Engineering in Practice, (2012); Schmidt, Douglas C., Model-driven engineering, Computer, 39, 2, pp. 25-31, (2006); Iovino, Ludovico, On the impact significance of metamodel evolution in MDE, Journal of Object Technology, 11, 3, (2012); Herrmannsdoerfer, Markus, COPE - A workbench for the coupled evolution of metamodels and models, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6563 LNCS, pp. 286-295, (2011); Wachsmuth, Guido H., Metamodel adaptation and model co-adaptation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4609 LNCS, pp. 600-624, (2007); Herrmannsdoerfer, Markus, Coupled evolution of software metamodels and models, pp. 33-63, (2014); Meyers, Bart, A framework for evolution of modelling languages, Science of Computer Programming, 76, 12, pp. 1223-1246, (2011); Hebig, Regina N., Approaches to co-evolution of metamodels and models: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 43, 5, pp. 396-414, (2017); Herrmannsdoerfer, Markus, An extensive catalog of operators for the coupled evolution of metamodels and models, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6563 LNCS, pp. 163-182, (2011); Khelladi, Djamel Eddine, Detecting complex changes and refactorings during (Meta)model evolution, Information Systems, 62, pp. 220-241, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09505849","","ISOTE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054005619"

However, due to the intermittence and randomness of wind speed, system operators and researchers urgently need to find more reliable wind-speed prediction methods. It was found that the time series of wind speed not only has linear characteristics, but also nonlinear. In addition, most methods only consider one criterion or rule (stability or accuracy), or one objective function, which can lead to poor forecasting results. So, wind-speed forecasting is still a difficult and challenging problem. The existing forecasting models based on combination-model theory can adapt to some time-series data and overcome the shortcomings of the single model, which achieves poor accuracy and instability. In this paper, a combined forecasting model based on data preprocessing, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) with three objective functions and four models (two hybrid nonlinear models and two linear models) is proposed and was successfully applied to forecasting wind speed, which not only overcomes the issue of forecasting accuracy, but also solves the difficulties of forecasting stability. The experimental results show that the stability and accuracy of the proposed combined model are better than the single models, improving the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) range from 0.007% to 2.31%, and the standard deviation mean absolute percentage error (STDMAPE) range from 0.0044 to 0.3497. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined model; Multi-objective optimization; Wind speed forecasting","","","","Funding: The research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No.71671029).","undefined; 2009 Wind Technologies Market Report, (2009); Yu, James, An over painted oriental arts: Evaluation of the development of the Chinese renewable energy market using the wind power market as a model, Energy Policy, 37, 12, pp. 5221-5225, (2009); Soman, Saurabh S., A review of wind power and wind speed forecasting methods with different time horizons, (2010); De Giorgi, Maria Grazia, Assessment of the benefits of numerical weather predictions in wind power forecasting based on statistical methods, Energy, 36, 7, pp. 3968-3978, (2011); Cassola, Federico, Wind speed and wind energy forecast through Kalman filtering of Numerical Weather Prediction model output, Applied Energy, 99, pp. 154-166, (2012); Wang, Jianzhou, Research and application of a combined model based on multi-objective optimization for multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting, Energy, 125, pp. 591-613, (2017); Zhao, Jing, An improved multi-step forecasting model based on WRF ensembles and creative fuzzy systems for wind speed, Applied Energy, 162, pp. 808-826, (2016); Yang, Hufang, A hybridwind speed forecasting system based on a 'decomposition and ensemble' strategy and fuzzy time series, Energies, 10, 9, (2017); 17 Conf on Probability and Statistics in the Atmospheric Sciences, (2004)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060581229"

The combat system of systems (SoS) presents the characteristics of multifunctional combat equipment and hybrid manned and unmanned force units. At present, the research of mission planning is mostly oriented to a single factor, does not consider a variety of operational activities. Therefore, how to describe the hybrid operational organization of multiple functions and force units and to accomplish mission planning for various operational activities has very practical significance. In this paper, the FINC(Force, Intelligence, Networking, C2) model is extended, a new model framework of unmanned combat force with the function of integrated observe and attack is proposed, which is called Force Intelligent Network Command and Control Model with autonomous platform (FINCA). Four types and eight different function chains are proposed for the hybrid Combat SoS. Through the capability requirements and resource constraints, the operational tasks are mapped to the types and quantities of function chains that needed to accomplish this task, and the multi-priority list dynamic reconstruction scheme (MPLDCS) method is used to generate the function chain planning scheme.

While this algorithm achieves good diversity, its convergence is unsatisfactory. In order to improve the convergence, we propose an improved NSGA-III using a genetic K-means clustering algorithm (NSGA-III-GKM), which can also ensure diversity and automatically provide the number and direction vector of the subspaces. Compared with the NSGA-III, the proposed NSGA-III-GKM has two key features. First, the initial reference points are clustered using a GKM clustering algorithm, which realizes automatic learning of the number of clusters. Second, as the reference points are replaced by cluster centers, a penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) aggregation function is introduced to replace the perpendicular distance. The proposed NSGA-III-GKM and other similar optimization algorithms (NSGA-III, MOEA/D, U-NSGA-III, DC-NSGA-III and B-NSGA-III) are tested on DTLZ test problems and UF test problems. The simulation results demonstrate that the NSGA-III-GKM exhibits better diversity and convergence performance than the other algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","automatic learning; genetic K-means clustering algorithm; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III","Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Aggregation functions; Automatic-learning; Convergence performance; Genetic K-means clustering; Many-objective optimizations; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-III; Optimization algorithms; K-means clustering","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61603398, and in part by the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China under Grant 2018JM6007.","Garcia-Najera, Abel, An investigation into many-objective optimization on combinatorial problems: Analyzing the pickup and delivery problem, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 38, pp. 218-230, (2018); Bazargan Lari, Kimia, An evolutionary based framework for many-objective optimization problems, Engineering Computations, 35, 4, pp. 1805-1828, (2018); Asafuddoula, Md, A decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for many objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 3, pp. 445-460, (2015); Bechikh, Slim, Many-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms: A survey, Adaptation, Learning, and Optimization, 20, pp. 105-137, (2017); Goulart, Fillipe, Preference-guided evolutionary algorithms for many-objective optimization, Information Sciences, 329, pp. 236-255, (2016); Evolutionary Computation, (1994); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Zhang, Jingrui, An improved NSGA-III integrating adaptive elimination strategy to solution of many-objective optimal power flow problems, Energy, 172, pp. 945-957, (2019); Ruan, Feng, A big data placement method using NSGA-III in meteorological cloud platform, Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2019, 1, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077953886"

In IoV, the increase of smart vehicle applications produces computation-intensive tasks for vehicles. However, it is tough for vehicles to meet the demands required by tasks thoroughly due to the limited computing capacity deployed in vehicles. To address this challenge, the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a promising technology to support edge computing transmitting tasks across vehicles. By employing vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), the origin vehicle seeks the feasible routes of offloading the computing tasks to the edge node (EN). In this paper, a computation offloading method which employs V2X technology for data transmission in edge computing, named V2X-COM, is proposed. Technically, the routing of the computing tasks is determined first. Then, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is adopted to generate balanced offloading strategies. Furthermore, simple additive weighting (SAW) and multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) are employed to seek out the optimal offloading strategy. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted to prove the validity of V2X-COM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","computation offloading; edge computing; IoV; latency; resource utilization","Behavioral research; Decision making; Edge computing; Genetic algorithms; Vehicles; Computation offloading; Computation-intensive task; Crowded traffic conditions; latency; Multiple criteria decision making; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Resource utilizations; Simple additive weighting; Vehicle to vehicle communications","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702277, Grant 61672276, and Grant 61702264, in part by the Key Research and Development Project of Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2015154 and Grant BE2016120, in part by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), in part by the Open Project from State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, under Grant KFKT2017B04, in part by the Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions Fund, in part by the Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), and in part by the College Students’ Enterprise and Entreprenuership Education Program (CSEEEP) of NUIST.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702277, Grant 61672276, and Grant 61702264, in part by the Key Research and Development Project of Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2015154 and Grant BE2016120, in part by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), in part by the Open Project from State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, under Grant KFKT2017B04, in part by the Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions Fund, in part by the Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), and in part by the College Students' Enterprise and Entreprenuership Education Program (CSEEEP) of NUIST.","Caai Trans Intell Technol, (2016); Seo, Hanbyeol, LTE evolution for vehicle-to-everything services, IEEE Communications Magazine, 54, 6, pp. 22-28, (2016); Choi, Youngjune, Special issue on V2X communications and networks, Journal of Communications and Networks, 19, 3, pp. 205-206, (2017); Bhover, Sushma U., V2X communication protocol in VANET for co-operative intelligent transportation system, pp. 602-607, (2017); Gerla, Mario, Internet of vehicles: From intelligent grid to autonomous cars and vehicular clouds, pp. 241-246, (2014); Kumar, Neerai Sathish, Bayesian Coalition Game as-A-Service for Content Distribution in Internet of Vehicles, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 1, 6, pp. 544-555, (2014); Feng, Jingyun, AVE: Autonomous vehicular edge computing framework with ACO-based scheduling, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 66, 12, pp. 10660-10675, (2017); Emara, Mustafa, MEC-aware cell association for 5G heterogeneous networks, pp. 350-355, (2018); Giust, Fabio, Multi-access edge computing: The driver behind the wheel of 5g-connected cars, IEEE Communications Standards Magazine, 2, 3, pp. 66-73, (2018); Zhang, Ke, Predictive Offloading in Cloud-Driven Vehicles: Using Mobile-Edge Computing for a Promising Network Paradigm, IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine, 12, 2, pp. 36-44, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077773965"

Considering that there are massive services needed to process in complex systems, the mobile services are offloaded from mobile devices to edge servers for efficient implementation. In spite of the benefits of complex systems and edge servers, massive resource requirements for implementing the increasing resource requests decrease the execution efficiency and affect the whole resource usage of edge servers. Therefore, it remains an issue to achieve dynamic scheduling of the computing resources across edge servers. With the consideration of this issue, a Balanced Resource Scheduling Method, named BRSM, for trade-offs between virtual machine (VM) migration cost and energy consumption of VM migrations for edge server management, named BRSM, is designed in this paper. Technically, we analyze the load conditions of edge servers and formulate the energy consumption of VM migrations and VM migration cost as a multi-objective optimization problem. Then, we propose a dynamic resource scheduling method for WMAN to deal with the multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is adopted to generate optimal resource scheduling strategies.

Among these purposes, Cost and Makespan are probably the most two primitive objectives. Another critical factor in a large-scale scientific workflow is tremendous amount of data during execution. Therefore, this work also includes Data Movement as an additional objective as it has a major impact on network utilization and energy consumption in network equipment in cloud data center. In considering these three objectives, this work proposes a framework for scheduling solutions which combines a new nodes clustering technique in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model known as Multilevel Dependent Node Clustering (MDNC) and the multi-objective optimization, Extreme Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (E-NSGA-III). E-NSGA-III is the recent extension of Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). Five well-known scientific workflows, CyberShake, Epigenomics, LIGO, Montage, and SIPHT are selected as testbeds, while the commonly known Hypervolume is chosen as the performance metric. In this work, MDNC is also experimented with both NSGA-III. Comparison among three approaches, E-NSGA-III alone, E-NSGA-III with Peer-to-Peer clustering and E-NSGA-III with MDNC are carried out.

Examples of possible uses are in factory and automation settings, robot sports teams, and urban search and rescue applications. We chose the rescue domain as a guiding example throughout this paper. Hence, this paper explores a practical variant of TOP with time window (TOPTW) for rescue applications by humanoid robots called TOPTWR. Due to the significant range of algorithm choices and their parameters tuning challenges, the use of hyper-heuristics is recommended. Hyper-heuristics can select, order, or generate different low-level heuristics with different optimization algorithms. In this paper, first, a general multi-objective (MO) solution is defined, with five objectives for TOPTWR. Then a robust and efficient MO and evolutionary hyperheuristic algorithm for TOPTW based on the humanoid robot’s characteristics in the rescue applications (MOHH-TOPTWR) is proposed. MOHH-TOPTWR includes two MO evolutionary metaheuristics algorithms (MOEAs) known as non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and MOEA based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In this paper, new benchmark instances are proposed for rescue applications using the existing ones for TOPTW. The experimental results show that MOHH-TOPTWR in both MOEAs can outperform all the state-of-the-art algorithms as well as NSGA-III and MOEA/D MOEAs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Benchmarking; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Evolutionary metaheuristic; Humanoid robot; Hyper-heuristic algorithms; Hyper-heuristics; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Multi objective; Multi-objective evolutionary; Team orienteering problems; Time windows; Urban search and rescue; Anthropomorphic robots","","","This work was financially supported by the \u2018Chinese Language and Technology Center\u2019 of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan, and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant Nos.

However, both GSO and BFOA show some difficulties when solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). To challenge MaOPs, a coupling approach based on GSO and BFOA is proposed in this paper. To implement the coupling method, an external archive is established to save the best solutions found so far. The internal populations in GSO and BFOA can exchange the search information with the external archive in the evolutionary process. Simulation experiments are verified on two benchmark sets (DTLZ and WFG) with 3 to 15 objectives.

How to better describe the multiple functions and forces hybrid combat SoS becomes a difficult problem. Changes in combat forces have transformed the operational style from single platform to cluster, which puts forward higher demands on the timeliness of the development of course of action(COA), which is the key step in the formulation of operational planning. It is of great military value to study the model of the hybrid new complex combat SoS, as well as the generation and optimization of the operational plan under the new combat model. This paper extends the FINC (Force, Intelligence, Networking, C2) model of heterogeneous networks, adds a variety of new intelligent unmanned combat force nodes, and proposes a new Force Intelligent Network C2 and Autonomous Model (FINCA2) which represents more different types of function nodes and communication relationships between nodes. Based on this, this paper proposes six types of 12 kinds functionally simple, frequently used, and practically function chains (FC) for the new combat SoS. Through the Joint Mission Thread (JMT) method, the operational mission is decomposed to get specific operational actions, action relationships, and requirements list of function chains for the actions, and complete the matching of actions and resources. Based on the idea of sigmoid function in neural network, the multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-III is improved to find the Pareto frontier of the action order scheme that satisfies the task association relationship. Finally, the method proposed in this paper is verified by the case of a brigade-level combat SoS participating in border operations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FINCA²; function chain; improved adaptive NSGA-III; Intelligent combat SoS; JMT","Heterogeneous networks; Multiobjective optimization; Communication relationships; Emerging technologies; improved adaptive NSGA-III; Intelligent combat SoS; Operational equipment; Operational mission; Operational planning; Optimization method; System of systems","","","This work was supported by the Doctoral Science Foundation-Funded Project of China under Grant 45832.","Research on Cloud Ammuition System Theory and Method, (2014); 9th Iccrts Int Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, (2004); Cares, Jeffrey R., Operations research for unmanned systems, pp. 1-302, (2016); Connections, (2002); Srivastava, Biplav, Scaling up planning by teasing out resource scheduling, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1809, pp. 172-186, (2000); A Discourse on Winning and Losing, (1987); Targeting Air Force Doctrine Document 2 1 9, (2006); Usjfcom; Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Dynamic Complexity in System of Systems R, (2007)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074664733"

The suggested NHBA algorithm modifies the local search manner by a monotone random filling model based on extreme (MRFME) and improves the population-diversity by mutation and crossover mechanisms. To obtain the uniformly distributed Pareto optimal set (POS) with zero constraint-violation, an innovative non-dominated sorting method combined with the constrained Pareto fuzzy dominant (CPFD) strategy is put forward in this paper. To verify the superiority of the proposed NHBA-CPFD algorithm, which is federated by the NHBA algorithm and the CPFD strategy, ten MOOPF simulation cases considering the basic fuel cost, the fuel cost with value-point loadings, the total emission, and the active power loss are studied on the IEEE 30-node, IEEE 57-node, and IEEE 118-node systems. In contrast to the NHBA, MOPSO, and NSGA-III algorithms which adopt the constrain-prior Pareto-dominance method (CPM), numerous results validate the NHBA-CPFD algorithm that can achieve more superior compromise solutions and preferable Pareto fronts (PFs) even in the large-scale systems. Furthermore, two performance metrics of generational distance (GD) and hyper-volume (HV) also demonstrate that the NHBA-CPFD algorithm has great advantages to obtain the feasible POS with evenly distribution and favorable-diversity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","constrained Pareto fuzzy dominant strategy; monotone random filling model based on extreme; multi-objective optimal power flow problem; Novel hybrid bat algorithm; performance metrics","Acoustic generators; Large scale systems; Pareto principle; Bat algorithms; Dominant strategy; Filling model; Multi-objective optimal power flow; Performance metrics; Electric load flow","","","This work was supported in part by the Innovation Team Program of the Chongqing Education Committee under Grant CXTDX201601019, in part by the Chongqing University Innovation Team under Grant KJTD201312, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51207064 and Grant 61463014.","Marinakis, Yannis, A Multi-Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, Information Sciences, 481, pp. 311-329, (2019); IEEE T Cybernetics, (2019); Attia, Abdul Fattah, Optimal power flow solution in power systems using a novel Sine-Cosine algorithm, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 99, pp. 331-343, (2018); MacKay, Laurens, Optimal power flow for unbalanced bipolar DC distribution grids, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 5199-5207, (2018); Chen, Pengwei, Dynamic optimal power flow model incorporating interval uncertainty applied to distribution network, IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution, 12, 12, pp. 2926-2936, (2018); Chen, Gonggui, Optimal reactive power dispatch by improved GSA-based algorithm with the novel strategies to handle constraints, Applied Soft Computing, 50, pp. 58-70, (2017); Prasad, Dharmbir, Application of chaotic whale optimisation algorithm for transient stability constrained optimal power flow, IET Science, Measurement and Technology, 11, 8, pp. 1002-1013, (2017); Chen, Gonggui, Optimal Power Flow Using Gbest-Guided Cuckoo Search Algorithm with Feedback Control Strategy and Constraint Domination Rule, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2017, (2017); Khunkitti, Sirote, A hybrid DA-PSO optimization algorithm for multiobjective optimal power flow problems, Energies, 11, 9, (2018); Duman, Serhat, A modified moth swarm algorithm based on an arithmetic crossover for constrained optimization and optimal power flow problems, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 45394-45416, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066824608"

In order to get close to the actual air combat, the game process between both sides at war is introduced to construct a three-objective mathematical model, which includes the damage of the enemy, the cost of missiles, and the damage value of fighting capacity. Considering the NP-complete nature of multi-objective weapon-target assignment problem, an improved intelligent algorithm (named as D-NSGA-III-A) on the basis of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is proposed. In this improved algorithm, first, the non-dominated sorting based on dominance degree matrix is proposed to reduce the unnecessary or repetitive comparisons in ranking schemes, so as to further decrease the time consumption. Second, diversity and convergence are taken into account resorting to the niching information and the dominance ratio when selecting individuals. Third, the adaptive operator selection mechanism, which selects the operators adaptively according to the information of generations from a pool where single point crossover and all bits crossover operators are included, is employed to seek a balance between intensification and diversification within the decision space and to improve the quality of Pareto solutions.

To establish the multiobjective FOPID controller optimization (MO-FOPID) problem under multiworking conditions, the integral of the time multiplied absolute error (ITAE) index of PTGS running at low and high working water heads is adopted as objective functions. An improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III based on Latin hypercube sampling and chaos theory (LCNSGA-III) is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The Latin hypercube sampling is adopted to generate well-distributed initial population and take full of the feasible domain while the chaos theory is introduced to enhance the global search and local exploration ability of the NSGA-III algorithm. The experimental results on eight test functions and a real-world PTGS have shown that the proposed multiobjective framework can improve the Pumped storage units’ adaptability to changeable working conditions and the proposed LCNSGA-III algorithm is able to solve the MO-FOPID problem effectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Chaos theory; Controllers; Genetic algorithms; Hydraulic turbines; Problem solving; Proportional control systems; Pumped storage power plants; Three term control systems; Controller optimization; Fractional-order PID controllers; Frequency oscillations; Latin hypercube sampling; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimization problems; Pumped-storage units; Single objective optimization; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51741907), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 51709121), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51709122).","Allan, Ronald N., Modelling of pumped-storage generation in sequential Monte Carlo production simulation, IEE Proceedings: Generation, Transmission and Distribution, 145, 5, pp. 611-615, (1998); Wang, Wenxiao, Study on unit commitment problem considering pumped storage and renewable energy via a novel binary artificial sheep algorithm, Applied Energy, 187, pp. 612-626, (2017); Zhou, Jianzhonga Zhong, A real-time accurate model and its predictive fuzzy PID controller for pumped storage unit via error compensation, Energies, 11, 1, (2018); Zhou, Jianzhonga Zhong, Parameter identification of pump turbine governing system using an improved backtracking search algorithm, Energies, 11, 7, (2018); Zhang, Chu, Modeling and synchronous optimization of pump turbine governing system using sparse robust least squares support vector machine and hybrid backtracking search algorithm, Energies, 11, 11, (2018); Xu, Yanhe, Adaptive condition predictive-fuzzy PID optimal control of start-up process for pumped storage unit at low head area, Energy Conversion and Management, 177, pp. 592-604, (2018); Natarajan, Krishnamoorthy, Robust PID controller design for hydroturbines, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 20, 3, pp. 661-667, (2005); Precup, Radu Emil, Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm-based approach to PID controller tuning for torque motor systems, pp. 127-132, (2015); Precup, Radu Emil, PI and PID controller tuning for an automotive application using backtracking search optimization algorithms, pp. 161-166, (2015); Khodabakhshian, Amin, A new PID controller design for automatic generation control of hydro power systems, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 32, 5, pp. 375-382, (2010)","","Hindawi Limited 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb New York NY 10022","","","","","","10990526; 10762787","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062859149"

Meta-heuristic optimization has been regarded as an effective solution for such problems because it enables the successful examination of a broad range of candidate solutions and the selection of optimal ones. However, there is a high probability of the algorithms becoming ensnared in local minima due to the complex optimization surface and the unlimited number of viable solutions. Therefore, to provide the decision maker with the optimal non-dominated set of solutions, significant improvements must be made to the search process, where the efficient exploration of the population has a vital role in maintaining a good non-dominated solution in evolutionary algorithms. NSGA-II is regarded as the state of the art for the meta-heuristic MOO. NSGA-II and its variants have adopted the concept of crowding distance as a measure that can leverage the characteristics of the distribution of solutions in the search space and provide a high-level of exploration. However, this method is not sufficient to effectively explore the search space because it ignores the direction of the exploration. In this paper, the angle quantization of solutions is combined with the crowding distance to create the MOGA-AQCD algorithm, which preserves equal exploration in all directions and aims at finding equal distribution of solutions within the search space. This approach is applied to a set of standard benchmark MOO functions. The results show that MOGA-AQCD is superior to NSGA-II and NSGA-III on the most evaluation measures for MOO. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","angle quantization; crowding distance; meta-heuristic search optimization; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-II","Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; angle quantization; Complex optimization; Crowding distance; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Meta-heuristic search; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Nondominated solutions; NSGA-II; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Project 2017YFB0802500, in part by the National Cryptography Development Fund under Project MMJJ20170106, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Project 61772538, Project 61672083, Project 61370190, Project 61532021, Project 61472429, Project 91646203, and Project 61402029.","Fei, Zesong, A Survey of Multi-Objective Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks: Metrics, Algorithms, and Open Problems, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 19, 1, pp. 550-586, (2017); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Yang, Ling, A novel dynamic crowding distance based diversity maintenance strategy for MOEAs, 1, pp. 211-216, (2017); Sun, Chengfu, An improved differential evolution and novel crowding distance metric for multi-objective optimization, pp. 265-268, (2010); Proc 4th Int Conf Soft Comput Problem Solving, (2015); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Han, Chuang, A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Based on Fitting and Interpolation, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 22920-22929, (2018); Cheng, Ran, A Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 5, pp. 773-791, (2016); Yuan, Yuan, A New Dominance Relation-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 1, pp. 16-37, (2016); Zhu, Yingying, An improved NSGA-III algorithm for feature selection used in intrusion detection, Knowledge-Based Systems, 116, pp. 74-85, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061090718"

This issue has been efficiently tackled by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, the third version, (NSGA-III). On the other hand, a concern about the NSGA-III algorithm is that it uses a fixed rate for mutation operator. To cope with this issue, this study introduces an adaptive mutation operator to enhance the performance of the standard NSGA-III algorithm. The proposed adaptive mutation operator strategy is evaluated using three crossover operators of NSGA-III including simulated binary crossover (SBX), uniform crossover (UC) and single point crossover (SI). Subsequently, three improved NSGA-III algorithms (NSGA-III SBXAM, NSGA-III SIAM, and NSGA-III UCAM) are developed.

To accomplish it, MOEAs incorporate strategies to determinate optimal trade-offs between each of the objective functions. In this paper, an Unassisted image Thresholding (UTH) methodology is proposed based on MOEAs. UTH takes advantage of the trade-off mechanisms present on MOEAs to perform the image thresholding while simultaneously determinating the number thresholds required to segment each image and the best placement of each threshold along the histogram of the image. The image thresholding problem is commonly addressed as the search for the best possible thresholds able to partition a given image into a finite number of homogeneous classes. Such approach requires the assistance of a designer to determinate the number of threshold values that will properly segment the image. However, as images can vary significantly, the definition of an optimal number of thresholds should be performed for each image. Thus, a methodology able to determinate both the number of thresholds and the best placement of each value contributes to a general segmentation scheme. In the proposed approach, UTH redefines the thresholding problem as a multi-objective task with two conflicting goals. The first goal is the quality of the segmented image, and it is computed as a non-parametric criteria to evaluate candidate threshold points. The second goal is the normalized number of threshold points. Since the number of thresholds is not fixed, a particle encoding the thresholds with variable length is used. The strategy of UTH is coupled with three MOEAs namely NSGA-III, PESA-II and MOPSO using as the non-parametric criteria the Cross Entropy. According to the results, the UTH–NSGA-III formulation outperforms UTH-PESA-II and UTH-MOPSO regarding convergence and quality of the resulting image. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross entropy; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Unassisted thresholding","Economic and social effects; Entropy; Image segmentation; Multiobjective optimization; Problem solving; Cross entropy; Image thresholding; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; NSGA-III; Objective functions; Segmentation scheme; Segmented images; Thresholding; Evolutionary algorithms","","","The first author acknowledges The National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) for the doctoral Grant number 298285 for supporting this research.","Akay, B., A study on particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithms for multilevel thresholding, Applied Soft Computing, 13, 6, pp. 3066-3091, (2013); Otsu, Nobuyukl, THRESHOLD SELECTION METHOD FROM GRAY-LEVEL HISTOGRAMS., IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-9, 1, pp. 62-66, (1979); Kapur, Jagat N., A new method for gray-level picture thresholding using the entropy of the histogram., Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing, 29, 3, pp. 273-285, (1985); Li, Chunhung, Minimum cross entropy thresholding, Pattern Recognition, 26, 4, pp. 617-625, (1993); Nawandhar, Archana A., Image segmentation using thresholding for cell nuclei detection of colon tissue, pp. 1199-1203, (2015); Sarkar, Soham, Hyper-spectral image segmentation using Rényi entropy based multi-level thresholding aided with differential evolution, Expert Systems with Applications, 50, pp. 120-129, (2016); Oliva, Diego Alberto, Cross entropy based thresholding for magnetic resonance brain images using Crow Search Algorithm, Expert Systems with Applications, 79, pp. 164-180, (2017); Journal of Applied Computer Science Mathematics Suceava, (2012); Zheng, Yue, Adaptive multi-level thresholding segmentation based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9712 LNCS, pp. 606-615, (2016); Tejani, Ghanshyam G., Adaptive symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm for structural design optimization, Journal of Computational Design and Engineering, 3, 3, pp. 226-249, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049651023"

It is responsible for performing two main tasks simultaneously. First, it has to promote convergence by selecting solutions which are as close as possible to the Pareto optimal set. And second, it has to promote diversity in the solution set provided. In the current work, an exhaustive study that involves the comparison of several selection mechanisms with different features is performed. Particularly, Pareto-based and indicator-based selection schemes, which belong to well-known multi-objective optimisers, are considered. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Each of those mechanisms is incorporated into a common multi-objective evolutionary algorithm framework. The main goal of the study is to measure the diversity preserved by each of those selection methods when addressing many-objective optimisation problems. The Walking Fish Group test suite, a set of optimisation problems with a scalable number of objective functions, is taken into account to perform the experimental evaluation. Findings: The computational results highlight that the the reference-point-based selection scheme of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III and a modified version of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, where the crowding distance is replaced by the Euclidean distance, are able to provide the best performance, not only in terms of diversity preservation, but also in terms of convergence. Originality/value: The performance provided by the use of the Euclidean distance as part of the selection scheme indicates this is a promising line of research and, to the best of the knowledge, it has not been investigated yet. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Diversity preservation; Many-objective optimisation; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; Selection mechanism; Walking Fish Group (WFG) test suite","Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Convergence; Diversity preservation; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Optimization problems; Selection mechanism; Selection methods; Selection scheme; Walking fish group test suite; Fish","","","","Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice, (1996); Hypervolume Based Search for Multiobjective Optimization Theory and Methods, (2010); Tik Report 286, (2008); Beume, Nicola, S-metric calculation by considering dominated hypervolume as Klee's measure problem, Evolutionary Computation, 17, 4, pp. 477-492, (2009); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Multiobjective Optimization Interactive and Evolutionary Approaches, (2008); Bringmann, Karl, Approximating the volume of unions and intersections of high-dimensional geometric objects, Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications, 43, 6-7, pp. 601-610, (2010); Brockhoff, Dimo, R2 indicator-based multiobjective search, Evolutionary Computation, 23, 3, pp. 369-395, (2015); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007); Practical Nonparametric Statistics, (1980)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","25149318; 25149288","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053035262"

We derive polynomial optimal solutions for special cases of this problem with a single objective and then develop heuristics with promising starting solutions for the multi-objective case. Due to NP-hardness of the problem, we apply a customized reference-based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) as solution procedures. Finally, we present extensive computational analysis to compare the performance of employed heuristic and metaheuristics on randomly generated instances.

These problems require careful attention to efficiently handle the increasing number of objectives and also to address the various challenges associated with these types of problems. The present study introduces a new unconstrained many-objective optimization algorithm called reference point based many objective simulated annealing algorithm (RSA). The algorithm is an amalgamation of several new modules including a reference point based clustering technique to control the size of the archive which stores the solutions, a novel mutation strategy termed as mutation-switching and a new acceptance probability function. Unlike the existing simulated annealing based multiobjective optimization techniques, the current work explores the use of archive-to-archive transition rather than point-to-point transition. The performance of RSA is validated and compared with many other state-of-the-art algorithms on a number of unconstrained benchmark problems of DTLZ and WFG test suites with up to 15 objectives. The experimental results show that RSA outperforms AMOSA, NSGA-III, MOEA/D-PBI and θ-DEA in terms of two well-known performance metrics, namely inverse generational distance (IGD) and hyper-volume (HV), for a majority of the test cases considered. It has also been shown that RSA usually requires fewer number of function evaluations compared to other algorithms for equal or better performance and might thus be more useful for MaOO problems which are expensive in terms of computational time. To illustrate some real-life applications of RSA, in a part of the paper, we have developed a multiobjective clustering technique utilizing RSA as the underlying optimization mechanism which is then used for segmenting satellite images.Obtained results prove the efficacy of RSA in solving the segmentation task. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acceptance probability; Clustering; Many-objective optimization; Mutation switching; Pareto optimality; Reference points; Simulated annealing","Benchmarking; Cluster analysis; Computation theory; Inverse problems; Metals; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Simulated annealing; Site selection; Clustering; Many-objective optimizations; Multi-objective clustering; Multi-objective optimization techniques; Pareto-optimality; Reference points; Simulated annealing algorithms; State-of-the-art algorithms; Clustering algorithms","","","","Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007); Zhou, Aimin Min, Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: A survey of the state of the art, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 1, 1, pp. 32-49, (2011); von Lucken Martinez, Christian Daniel, A survey on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for many-objective problems, Computational Optimization and Applications, 58, 3, pp. 707-756, (2014); Li, Bingdong, Many-objective evolutionary algorithms: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 48, 1, (2015); Fleming, P.

One of the known rationales is the loss of selection pressure which leads to the selected parents not generating promising offspring toward Pareto-optimal front (PF) with diversity. Estimation of distribution algorithms sample new solutions with a probabilistic model built from the statistics extracting over the existing solutions so as to mitigate the adverse impact of genetic operators. In this paper, an improved regularity-based estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to effectively tackle unconstrained MaOPs. In the proposed algorithm, diversity repairing mechanism is utilized to mend the areas, where need nondominated solutions with a closer proximity to the PF. Then favorable solutions are generated by the model built from the regularity of the solutions surrounding a group of representatives. These two steps collectively enhance the selection pressure which gives rise to the superior convergence of the proposed algorithm. In addition, dimension reduction technique is employed in the decision space to speed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm. Finally, by assigning the Pareto-optimal solutions to the uniformly distributed reference vectors, a set of solutions with excellent diversity and convergence is obtained. To measure the performance, NSGA-III, GrEA, MOEA/D, HypE, MBN-EDA, and RM-MEDA are selected to perform comparison experiments over DTLZ and DTLZ- test suites with 3-, 5-, 8-, 10-, and 15-objective.

However, the performance of these algorithms is highly sensitive toward the number of objective functions and number of decision variables. Recently, it has been explored by the researchers that the performance of such algorithm degrades when the number of objective functions and decision variables increases by some limit. Hence, these algorithms can be hardly acceptable to the real-world optimization problems such as software module clustering problem (SMCP), which contains a large number of objective functions and decision variables. Previous researchers have proposed several approaches to address the many-objective optimization problems by revising existing meta-heuristic algorithms. Recently, an artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), a meta-heuristic algorithm, effectively used to address the several multi-objective optimization problems. Even though in most of the cases ABC algorithm performs better compared to other meta-heuristic algorithms, it faces the same problems as other meta-heuristic algorithms for a large number of objective functions and decision variables. This paper proposes a many-objective artificial bee colony (MaABC) algorithm to solve many-objective SMCPs. In this contribution, we revised the original ABC by using, quality indicator, L<inf>p</inf>-norm-based (p < 1) distances, and two external archives concepts. To validate the proposed approach, an extensive comparative study is performed with the existing many-objective optimization algorithms (i.e., Two-Arch2, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and IBEA) over seven SMCPs. The statistical analysis of the results show that the proposed MaABC outperforms existing many-objective approaches in terms of modularization quality (MQ), cohesion, coupling, and inverted generational distance (IGD). © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial bee colony; Many-objective optimization; Meta-heuristic algorithm; Software module clustering","Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Modular construction; Multiobjective optimization; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Many-objective optimizations; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic search algorithms; Multi-objective optimization problem; Software modules; Clustering algorithms","","","","Aggarwal, Charu C., On the surprising behavior of distance metrics in high dimensional space, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1973, pp. 420-434, (2001); Akay, B., A modified Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for real-parameter optimization, Information Sciences, 192, pp. 120-142, (2012); Amarjeet, An empirical study of the sensitivity of quality indicator for software module clustering, pp. 206-211, (2014); Journal of King Saud University Computer and Information Science, (2015); Amarjeet, Harmony search based remodularization for object-oriented software systems, Computer Languages, Systems and Structures, 47, pp. 153-169, (2017); Amarjeet, TA-ABC: Two-Archive Artificial Bee Colony for Multi-objective Software Module Clustering Problem, Journal of Intelligent Systems, 27, 4, pp. 619-641, (2018); Amarjeet, Improving modular structure of software system using structural and lexical dependency, Information and Software Technology, 82, pp. 96-120, (2017); Amarjeet, Improving package structure of object-oriented software using multi-objective optimization and weighted class connections, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 29, 3, pp. 349-364, (2017); Arcuri, Andrea, Parameter tuning or default values?

However, the current research at the organizational level is basically nonexistent. Therefore, we propose a methodology for designing an optimized architecture that is a significant product at this level to fill this technical gap. The design process consists of two steps: architecture modeling and coevolutionary optimization. The architecture model is composed of three basic elements, which are mission, equipment, and the command and control structure. The selection of the best scheme from possible solutions is a multiobjective optimization problem, and its computational complexity increases rapidly with the increase in the scale of combat system of systems. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm NSGA-III and improve it by using preference vectors to enhance the algorithm's local search capability. Finally, we conduct the comparative experiments on benchmark test suites and design an operation case to demonstrate the advance and effectiveness of the enhanced algorithm. The proposed architecture modeling and optimization method can achieve a set of nondominated solutions and provide auxiliary decision-making information to help commanders make decisions and arrangements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Architecture modeling; coevolutionary optimization algorithm; combat system-of-systems; unmanned combat system","Analytical models; Benchmarking; Bibliographies; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Product design; System of systems; Systems engineering; Architecture modeling; Combat Systems; Command and control (C2); Computational model; Multi-objective optimization problem; Nondominated solutions; Optimization algorithms; Optimized architectures; Computer architecture","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61403404 and in part by the Distinguished Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province under Grant 2017JJ1001.","Zhu, Qian, Connectivity maintenance based on multiple relay UAVs selection scheme in cooperative surveillance, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 7, 1, (2017); Garcia-Aunon, Pablo, Comparison of heuristic algorithms in discrete search and surveillance tasks using aerial swarms, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 8, 5, (2018); Sannier, Adrian V., UAV Swarm Control: Calculating Digital Pheromone Fields with the GPU, Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation, 3, 3, pp. 167-176, (2006); Demir, Kadir Alpaslan, Unmanned aerial vehicle domain: Areas of research, Defence Science Journal, 65, 4, pp. 319-329, (2015); Liu, Yuefeng, Cooperative task assignment method of manned/unmanned aerial vehicle formation, Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics, 32, 3, pp. 584-588, (2010); Li, Bo, Cooperative task assignment algorithm of manned/unmanned aerial vehicle in uncertain environment, 2018-January, pp. 1119-1123, (2017); Shima, Tal Y., Multiple task assignments for cooperating uninhabited aerial vehicles using genetic algorithms, Computers and Operations Research, 33, 11, pp. 3252-3269, (2006); Xinzeng, Wang, Based on PSO algorithm multiple task assignments for cooperating UAVs, 2, pp. V225-V228, (2010); Kou, Kunhu, Task assignment and route planning method of cooperative attack for manned/unmanned aerial vehicles, 2018-January, pp. 168-176, (2017); McLain, Timothy W., Cooperative Path Planning for Timing-Critical Missions, Proceedings of the American Control Conference, 1, pp. 296-301, (2003)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053628259"

In our suggested MODFA algorithm, a constrained Pareto-dominant approach (CPA) is offered for guaranteeing zero violations of various inequality constraints on state variables in the constrained MOOPF problem. In addition to that, the CPA and the dimension-based technology (DT) are federated together to update the information of the non-dominant firefly to speed up the convergence of multiple target search. Crowding distance and non-dominated sorting based on the violation of constraints are also regarded as measures to sustain well-distributed Pareto optimal solution (POS) set. Furthermore, a fuzzy affiliation is utilized to pick the best compromise solution (BCS) from the obtained POS. The IEEE30-bus system, the IEEE57-bus system, and the IEEE118-bus system with nine cases are implemented to validate the performance of the proposed MODFA by considering the active power losses, the emission, and the total fuel cost. The numerous simulation results optimized by the MODFA, which are compared with frequently-used NSGA-III, NSGA-II, and MOPSO algorithm, show the capability of the MODFA for obtaining POS with uniform distribution and high quality. Additionally, three performance metrics are considered to evaluate approximation, distribution, and diversity of POS found by MODFA. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained Pareto-dominant approach (CPA); Dimension-based technology (DT); Multi-objective dimension-based firefly algorithm (MODFA); Multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem; Performance metrics","Acoustic generators; Buses; Constraint theory; Electric load flow; Pareto principle; Constrained Pareto-dominant approach (CPA); Dimension-based technology (DT); Firefly algorithms; Multi-objective optimal power flow; Performance metrics; Bioluminescence","","","The authors would like to thank the editors and the reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

The area (or volume) under the convex hull has been used as a scalar indicator for the performance of a set of classifiers in ROC and DET space. Recently, 3D convex-hull-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (3DCH-EMOA) has been proposed to maximize the volume of convex hull for binary classification combined with parsimony and three-way classification problems. However, 3DCH-EMOA revealed high consumption of computational resources due to redundant convex hull calculations and a frequent execution of nondominated sorting. In this paper, we introduce incremental convex hull calculation and a fast replacement for non-dominated sorting. While achieving the same high quality results, the computational effort of 3DCH-EMOA can be reduced by orders of magnitude. The average time complexity of 3DCH-EMOA in each generation is reduced from O(n2logn) to O(nlogn) per iteration, where n is the population size. Six test function problems are used to test the performance of the newly proposed method, and the algorithms are compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, including NSGA-III, RVEA, etc., which were not compared to 3DCH-EMOA before. Experimental results show that the new version of the algorithm (3DFCH-EMOA) can speed up 3DCH-EMOA for about 30 times for a typical population size of 300 without reducing the performance of the method. Besides, the proposed algorithm is applied for neural networks pruning, and several UCI datasets are used to test the performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Area under ROC; Convex hull; Indicator-based evolutionary algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; ROC analysis","Communication channels (information theory); Computational geometry; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Population statistics; Area under ROC; Convex hull; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms; Machine learning communities; Performance of classifier; Receiver operating characteristics; ROC analysis; State-of-the-art algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms","","","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan (No. 2016YFC0600908 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1610124 , 61572505 and 61772530 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20171192 ).

Most often, they are designed by human experts in order to optimise a certain criterion. However, it is seldom the case that a schedule should optimise a single criterion all alone. More common is the case where several criteria need to be optimised at the same time. This paper deals with the problem of automatic design of dispatching rules (DRs) by the use of genetic programming, for many-objective scheduling problems. Four multi-objective and many-objective algorithms, including nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III, harmonic distance based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, have been used in order to obtain sets of Pareto optimal solutions for various many-objective scheduling problems. Through experiments it was shown that automatically generated multi-objective DRs not only achieve good performance when compared to standard DRs, but can also outperform automatically generated single objective DRs for most criteria combinations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dispatching rules; Genetic programming; Many-objective optimisation; Scheduling; Unrelated machines environment","Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Optimization; Pareto principle; Problem solving; Scheduling; Automatically generated; Dispatching rules; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective optimisation; Pareto optimal solutions; Unrelated machines; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","Allahverdi, Ali, A review of scheduling research involving setup considerations, Omega (United Kingdom), 27, 2, pp. 219-239, (1999); Allahverdi, Ali, A survey of scheduling problems with setup times or costs, European Journal of Operational Research, 187, 3, pp. 985-1032, (2008); Attar, Seyedeh Fatemeh, Hybrid flexible flowshop scheduling problem with unrelated parallel machines and limited waiting times, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 68, 5-8, pp. 1583-1599, (2013); Baykasoğlu, Adil, Discovering task assignment rules for assembly line balancing via genetic programming, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 76, 1-4, pp. 417-434, (2015); Branke, Juergen, Evolutionary search for difficult problem instances to support the design of job shop dispatching rules, European Journal of Operational Research, 212, 1, pp. 22-32, (2011); Branke, Juergen, Automated Design of Production Scheduling Heuristics: A Review, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20, 1, pp. 110-124, (2016); Braun, Tracy D., A Comparison of Eleven Static Heuristics for Mapping a Class of Independent Tasks onto Heterogeneous Distributed Computing Systems, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 61, 6, pp. 810-837, (2001); Burke, Edmund K., Exploring hyper-heuristic methodologies with genetic programming, Intelligent Systems Reference Library, 1, 1, pp. 177-201, (2009); Handbook of Metaheuristics, (2010); Cardoen, Brecht, Optimizing a multiple objective surgical case sequencing problem, International Journal of Production Economics, 119, 2, pp. 354-366, (2009)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","15737632; 13892576","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029071697"

Although, many current Multi-Objective optimization algorithms can efficiently solve problems with 3 or less objectives, their performance deteriorates proportionally with the increasing of the objectives number. Furthermore, in many situations the decision maker (DM) is not interested in all trade-off solutions obtained but rather interested in a single optimum solution or a small set of those trade-offs. Therefore, determining an optimum solution or a small set of trade-off solutions is a difficult task. However, an interesting method for finding such solutions is identifying solutions in the Knee region. Solutions in the Knee region can be considered the best obtained solution in the obtained trade-off set especially if there is no preference or equally important objectives. In this paper, a pruning strategy was used to find solutions in the Knee region of Pareto optimal fronts for some benchmark problems obtained by NSGA-II, MOEA/D-DE and a promising new Multi-Objective optimization algorithm NSGA-III. Lastly, those knee solutions found were compared and evaluated using a generational distance performance metric, computation time and a statistical one-way ANOVA test. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision making; Knee-based MOEAs; Many-objective optimization; Multi-objective optimization","","","","","López-Jaimes, Antonio, Many-objective problems: Challenges and methods, pp. 1033-1046, (2015); Sudeng, Sufian, A decomposition-based approach for knee solution approximation in multi-objective optimization, pp. 3710-3717, (2016); Das, Indraneel, On characterizing the `knee' of the Pareto curve based on normal-boundary intersection, Structural Optimization, 18, 2-3, pp. 107-115, (1999); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Zhang, Qingfu, MOEA/D: A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 11, 6, pp. 712-731, (2007); Sudeng, Sufian, A knee-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm: an extension to network system optimization design problem, Cluster Computing, 19, 1, pp. 411-425, (2016); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Bechikh, Slim, Searching for knee regions in multi-objective optimization using mobile reference points, Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 1118-1125, (2010); Bechikh, Slim, Searching for knee regions of the Pareto front using mobile reference points, Soft Computing, 15, 9, pp. 1807-1823, (2011); Li, Hui, Multiobjective optimization problems with complicated pareto sets, MOEA/ D and NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 13, 2, pp. 284-302, (2009)","","ECTI Association","","","","","","22869131","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062155313"

Pareto-surface metrics such as IGD, HV, and Spread are simple and provide knowledge about the overall performance of the solution set. However, these measures do not provide any insight into the distribution or spread of a solution set with respect to each objective. Further, in many-objective optimization, visualization of true Pareto fronts or obtained non-dominated solutions is difficult. A proper visualization tool must be able to show the location, range, shape, and distribution of obtained non-dominated solutions (both Pareto-surface and objective-wise distribution). Existing commonly used visualization tools in many-objective optimization (e.g., parallel coordinates) fail to show the shape of the Pareto front or distribution of solutions along each objective. In this paper, we propose an extension of recently proposed visualization method called 3D-RadVis (we call it 3D-RadVis Antenna) to visualize the distribution of solutions along each objective. 3D-RadVis Antenna is capable of mapping M-dimensional objective space to a 3-dimensional radial coordinate plot while seeking to preserve the relative location of solutions, shape of the Pareto front, and distribution of solutions along each objective. Furthermore, 3D-RadVis Antenna can be used by decision-makers to visually navigate large many-objective solution sets, to observe the evolutionary process, to visualize the relative location of a solution, to evaluate trade-offs among objectives, and to select preferred solutions. Along with this visualization tool, we propose two novel performance measures, named objective-wise inverse generational distance (ObjIGD) and line distribution (∆<inf>Line</inf>) to measure the convergence and distribution of solutions along each objective as well as the overall performance of approximate solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated on widely used many-objective benchmark problems containing a variety of Pareto fronts (linear, concave, convex, mixed, and disconnected). In addition, for a case study, we have demonstrated the capability of 3D-RadVis Antenna combined with the proposed performance measures for visual progress tracking of the NSGA-III algorithm through generations.

It is necessary to develop battery energy storage. The MG central controller is helping to develop it in the MG system for improving the time of availability. Thus, reducing the total energy expenses of MG and improving the renewable energy sources (battery energy storage) are considered together with the operation management of the MG system. This study proposes fitness-based modified game particle swarm optimisation (FMGPSO) algorithm to optimise the total costs of operation and pollutant emissions in the MG and multi-MG system. The optimal size of battery energy storage is also considered. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III, a multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and a speed-constrained multi-objective particle swarm optimisation are compared with the proposed FMGPSO to show the performance. The results of the simulation show that the FMGPSO outperforms both the comparison algorithms for the minimisation operation management problem of the MG and the multi-MG system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Battery storage; Constrained optimization; Covariance matrix; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Natural resources; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Screening; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage; Grid control; Microgrid; Microgrid systems; Multi micro-grids; Operation management; Particle swarm; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy source; Swarm optimization; Electric batteries","","","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers JP16K00117, JP15K15976, and KDDI Foundation.","Tan, Xingguo, Advances and trends of energy storage technology in Microgrid, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 44, 1, pp. 179-191, (2013); Chen, Shuaixun, Sizing of energy storage for microgrids, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 1, pp. 142-151, (2012); Aghamohammadi, Mohammad Reza, A new approach for optimal sizing of battery energy storage system for primary frequency control of islanded Microgrid, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 54, pp. 325-333, (2014); Bahmani-Firouzi, Bahman, Optimal sizing of battery energy storage for micro-grid operation management using a new improved bat algorithm, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 56, pp. 42-54, (2014); Kim, Hakman, A new challenge of microgrid operation, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 78 CCIS, pp. 250-260, (2010); Chakraborty, Sudipta, Distributed intelligent energy management system for a single-phase high-frequency AC microgrid, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 54, 1, pp. 97-109, (2007); Hao, Guangke, PSO applied to optimal operation of a micro-grid with wind power, Proceedings - International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming, PAAP, pp. 46-51, (2014); Mitra, Joydeep, Reliability-based sizing of backup storage, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 25, 2, pp. 1198-1199, (2010); Ekren, Orhan, Size optimization of a PV/wind hybrid energy conversion system with battery storage using simulated annealing, Applied Energy, 87, 2, pp. 592-598, (2010); Chen, Changsong, Smart energy management system for optimal microgrid economic operation, IET Renewable Power Generation, 5, 3, pp. 258-267, (2011)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","23983396","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112763757"

Since different matching algorithms, called matchers, do not necessarily find the same correct correspondences, usually several competing matchers are applied to the same pair of instances in order to increase evidence towards a potential match or mismatch. How to select, combine and tune different instance matchers to obtain the high quality instance alignment is one of the main challenges in LOD domain. Recently, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are appearing as an effective methodology to address this challenge. However, traditional EA based approaches ignore the effects brought about by different instance mapping’s preference on different matchers, which could significantly reduce the alignment’s quality, and the weights determined in this way could be problem-specific, which might not be reused in other instance matching scenarios. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-III based many-objective instance matching approach, which can tradeoff each mapping’s preference on various matchers and determine the optimal instance alignment without tuning different matchers’ aggregating weights. The experiment is conducted on the ISLab Instance Matching Benchmark (IIMB) provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), and the comparisons with OAEI’s participants show the effectiveness of our proposal. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Linked open data; Many-objective instance matching; NSGA-III","Communication channels (information theory); Genetic algorithms; Mapping; Semantics; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Instance matching; Linked open data (LOD); Matching algorithm; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-III; Ontology alignment evaluation initiative (OAEI); Semantic correspondence; Linked data","","","Acknowledgements.

This is mainly because the loss of selection pressure that occurs when updating the swarm. The number of nondominated individuals is substantially increased and the diversity maintenance mechanisms in MOPSOs always guide the particles to explore sparse regions of the search space. This behavior results in the final solutions being distributed loosely in objective space, but far away from the true Pareto-optimal front. To avoid the above scenario, this paper presents a balanceable fitness estimation method and a novel velocity update equation, to compose a novel MOPSO (NMPSO), which is shown to be more effective to tackle MaOPs. Moreover, an evolutionary search is further run on the external archive in order to provide another search pattern for evolution. The DTLZ and WFG test suites with 4-10 objectives are used to assess the performance of NMPSO. Our experiments indicate that NMPSO has superior performance over four current MOPSOs, and over four competitive multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (SPEA2-SDE, NSGA-III, MOEA/DD, and SRA), when solving most of the test problems adopted. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fitness estimation method; many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs); particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Evolutionary algorithms; Health; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Diversity maintenance; Estimation methods; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Pareto-optimal front; Particle swarm optimizers; Selection pressures; Velocity update equation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","","Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Shim, Vui Ann, Adaptive Memetic Computing for Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 45, 4, pp. 610-621, (2015); Coello, Carlos A., Handling multiple objectives with particle swarm optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 8, 3, pp. 256-279, (2004); Hu, Wang, Adaptive multiobjective particle swarm optimization based on parallel cell coordinate system, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 1-18, (2015); Evolutionary Methods for Design Optimisation and Control, (2002); Khare, Vineet R., Performance scaling of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2632, pp. 376-390, (2003); Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra, An algorithm for many-objective optimization with reduced objective computations: A study in differential evolution, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 3, pp. 400-413, (2015); Zhang, Xingyi, A knee point-driven evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 19, 6, pp. 761-776, (2015)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041355226"

In this paper, we propose an improved MOEA/D (multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition) based on reference distance (MOEA/D-RD) to solve the software project portfolio optimization problems with optimizing 2, 3, and 4 objectives. MOEA/D-RD replaces solutions based on reference distance during evolution process. Experimental comparison and analysis are performed among MOEA/D-RD and several state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, that is, MOEA/D, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA2), and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA3). The results show that MOEA/D-RD and NSGA2 can solve the software project portfolio optimization problem more effectively. For 4-objective optimization problem, MOEA/D-RD is the most efficient algorithm compared with MOEA/D, NSGA2, and NSGA3 in terms of coverage, distribution, and stability of solutions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Financial data processing; Genetic algorithms; Pareto principle; Software engineering; Experimental comparison; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimization problems; Pareto-optimal front; Project portfolio optimization; Stability of solutions; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project nos. 61202296, 71102146, 61272067, 61370229, and 61370178, the National High-Technology Research and Development Program (“863” program) of China under Grant no. 2013AA01A212, the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province Project no.

First, an adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy is proposed to decompose the objective space into several subspaces. According to different subspace densities, the weight vector is sparse or densely adjusted to ensure the uniformity of the weight vector distribution on the Pareto front surface. Secondly, the evolutionary model that combines the new differential evolution strategy and genetic evolution strategy is proposed to generate new individuals and enhance the exploration ability of the weight vector in each subspace. The proposed algorithm is tested on the optimization problem of 3-15 objectives on the DTLZ standard test set and WFG test instances, and it is compared with the five algorithms with better effect. In this paper, the Whitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used to test the significance of the algorithm.

In order to describe the actual condition, this paper presents a novel multiobjective programming model for balancing a mixed-model two-sided assembly line subject to multiple constraints, in which, additional constraints including zoning, synchronous, and positional constraints are considered besides the traditional constraints, e.g., the precedence constraint. Two objectives are simultaneously to be optimized, one is to minimize the combination of the weighted line efficiency and the weighted smoothness index, and the other is to minimize the weighted total relevant costs per unit of a product. A novel multiobjective hybrid imperialist competitive algorithm (MOHICA) is proposed to solve this problem. In the presented MOHICA, the sigma method is employed to quantify every individual, a novel merging method is introduced to reserve better individuals into the evolutionary population, and late acceptance hill-climbing (LAHC) algorithm is presented as a local search algorithm to achieve accurate balance between intensification and diversification. The experimental results on the selected benchmark instances and a practical case show that the proposed multiobjective algorithm outperforms nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-II, multiobjective improved teachinglearning-based optimization, and NSGA-III existing in the literature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA); Late acceptance hill-climbing (LAHC); Multiobjective algorithm; Twosided assembly line","Assembly machines; Benchmarking; Computer programming; Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Hill climbing; Imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA); Imperialist competitive algorithms; Intensification and diversifications; Multi objective algorithm; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Two-sided assembly lines; Assembly","","","Manuscript received December 28, 2015; revised March 7, 2016, April 29, 2016, and June 16, 2016; accepted July 27, 2016.

Although classical multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), such as SPEA2 and NSGA-II, have been designed to manipulate any number of objectives, the results of their practical application to MOPs with more than three objectives revealed that they have limitations. Many-objective algorithms represent the novelty in MOEA research because they are specially designed to handle search spaces of high dimension. In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm able to handle discrete optimization problems with many objectives is proposed, called Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Non-dominated Decomposed Sets (MEANDS). MEANDS decomposes the original MOP into several, simpler MOPs, for which sub-populations of non-dominated solutions are maintained and evolved together. MEANDS relaxes several restrictions of predecessor algorithms, such as the size of sub-populations and the need for weights in the lower dimension MOPs. Empirical results show that MEANDS was able to find better solutions than those from well-known MOEAs (NSGA-III, SPEA2, SPEA2+SDE, MOEA/D, MOEA/DD, and its predecessor MEAMT) in the multicast routing problem involving 4, 5, and 6 QoS-based objectives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Many-objective algorithms; Metaheuristics; Multi-objective optimization; Multicast routing","Genetic algorithms; Multicasting; Multiobjective optimization; Network routing; Optimization; Routing algorithms; Discrete optimization problems; High dimensions; Meta heuristics; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multicast routing; Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs); Nondominated solutions; Sub-populations; Evolutionary algorithms","","","GMBO has been supported by the Brazilian agencies FAPEMIG , CNPq and CAPES .

B., Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","This paper presents a method that able to predict the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The method uses shorter heart rate variability (HRV) signals when compared to existing methods, and achieves good prediction accuracy. PAF is a common cardiac arrhythmia that increases the health risk of a patient, and the development of an accurate predictor of the onset of PAF is clinical important because it increases the possibility to electrically stabilize and prevent the onset of atrial arrhythmias with different pacing techniques. We propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III for optimizing the baseline PAF prediction system, that consists of the stages of pre-processing, HRV feature extraction, and support vector machine (SVM) model. The pre-processing stage comprises of heart rate correction, interpolation, and signal detrending. After that, time-domain, frequency-domain, non-linear HRV features are extracted from the pre-processed data in feature extraction stage. Then, these features are used as input to the SVM for predicting the PAF event. The proposed optimization algorithm is used to optimize the parameters and settings of various HRV feature extraction algorithms, select the best feature subsets, and tune the SVM parameters simultaneously for maximum prediction performance. The proposed method achieves an accuracy rate of 87.7%, which significantly outperforms most of the previous works. This accuracy rate is achieved even with the HRV signal length being reduced from the typical 30 min to just 5 min (a reduction of 83%). Furthermore, another significant result is the sensitivity rate, which is considered more important that other performance metrics in this paper, can be improved with the trade-off of lower specificity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arrhythmia prediction; Feature selection; Heart rate variability; Multi-objective optimization; Non-dominated Sorting genetic algorithm III; Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","Biomedical signal processing; Cardiology; Diseases; Economic and social effects; Extraction; Forecasting; Frequency domain analysis; Genetic algorithms; Health risks; Heart; Multiobjective optimization; Sorting; Support vector machines; Time domain analysis; Feature extraction algorithms; Feature extraction stages; Heart rate variability; Multi-objective optimization algorithms; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Paroxysmal atrial fibrillations; Prediction performance; Feature extraction; Article; benchmarking; chromosome; diagnostic accuracy; entropy; genetic algorithm; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; nonlinear system; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; prediction; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; support vector machine; algorithm; atrial fibrillation; electrocardiography; pathophysiology; Algorithms; Atrial Fibrillation; Electrocardiography; Humans; Support Vector Machine","","","","Eur Heart J, (2010); Manolis, Athanasios John, Hypertension and atrial fibrillation: Diagnostic approach, prevention and treatment.

The formulation of software module clustering problem (SMCP) as SBSE problem facilitates the application of many MOEAs. Even though MOEAs are being used successfully to solve the SMCPs, the performance of Pareto-dominance based MOEAs degrade if the number of objective functions is greater than three. To address the large and complex many-objective SMCPs (MaSMCPs), changes in MOEAs are essential. This paper proposes a Fuzzy-Pareto dominance driven Artificial bee colony (FP-ABC) to solve the MaSMCPs effectively and efficiently. In this contribution, fuzzy-Pareto dominance and two external archive concepts have been integrated into artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The fuzzy-Pareto dominance improves the selection process of candidate solution and two external archives concept helps in balancing the convergence and diversity. To validate the supremacy of the proposed approach, a comparative study is performed with the existing many-objective optimization algorithms such as Two-Arch2, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and IBEA, over seven real-world problems. The statistical analysis of the results indicates that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in terms of modularization quality (MQ), coupling, cohesion, and Inverted Generational Distance (IGD). © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial bee colony; Many-objective optimization; Software module clustering","Application programs; Clustering algorithms; Modular construction; Optimization; Software engineering; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Many-objective optimizations; Modularization qualities; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Search based software engineering (SBSE); Software modules; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","Lehman, Manny M., On understanding laws, evolution, and conservation in the large-program life cycle, Journal of Systems and Software, 1, C, pp. 213-221, (1979); Mancoridis, Spiros, Bunch: a clustering tool for the recovery and maintenance of software system structures, Conference on Software Maintenance, pp. 50-59, (1999); Praditwong, Kata, Software module clustering as a multi-objective search problem, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 37, 2, pp. 264-282, (2011); Doval, D., Automatic clustering of software systems using a genetic algorithm, pp. 73-81, (1999); Mancoridis, Spiros, Using automatic clustering to produce high-level system organizations of source code, Program Comprehension, Workshop Proceedings, pp. 45-52, (1998); Mahdavi, Kiarash, A Multiple Hill Climbing Approach to Software Module Clustering, IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance, ICSM, pp. 315-324, (2003); Mkaouer, Mohamed Wiem, Many-objective software remodularization using NSGA-III, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 24, 3, (2015); Amarjeet, Harmony search based remodularization for object-oriented software systems, Computer Languages, Systems and Structures, 47, pp. 153-169, (2017); Kumari, A.

The recently presented non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) employs the decomposition idea to efficiently promote the population diversity. However, due to the low selection pressure of the Pareto-dominance relation the convergence of NSGA-III could still be improved. For this purpose, an improved NSGA-III algorithm based on niche-elimination operation (we call it NSGA-III-NE) is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, an adaptive penalty distance (APD) function is presented to consider the importance of convergence and diversity in the different stages of the evolutionary process. Moreover, the niche-elimination operation is designed by exploiting the niching technique and the worse-elimination strategy. The niching technique identifies the most crowded subregion, and the worse-elimination strategy finds and further eliminates the worst individual. The proposed NSGA-III-NE is tested on a number of well-known benchmark problems with up to fifteen objectives and shows the competitive performance compared with five state-of-the-art decomposition-based algorithms. Additionally, a vector angle based selection strategy is also proposed for handling irregular Pareto fronts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive penalty distance; Convergence; Many-objective optimization; Niche-elimination operation; NSGA-III","Benchmarking; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Adaptive penalty; Convergence; Many-objective optimizations; Niche-elimination operation; NSGA-III; Evolutionary algorithms","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61175126) and the International S&T Cooperation Program of China (Grant No. 2015DFG12150).

This paper establishes a multi-objective MINO model for the LCSTD problem, in which two criteria reflecting the interests of shippers on the one side and owners of the lock on the other side are considered as two parallel optimization objectives. The LCSTD problem is separated into three sub-problems. The first sub-problem concerns the lockage number and lockage direction determination, while the second and third sub-problems refer to lockage time optimization and ship placement, respectively. An orthogonal design-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (ONSGA-III) is presented, and then, we combine the ONSGA-III with a time-area series assignment method to optimize the LCSTD problem. Meanwhile, a heuristic adjustment strategy is proposed according to the structure of the lockage time optimization sub-problem to enhance the exploration ability of ONSGA-III. Furthermore, a compromise solution is chosen from the achieved non-dominated Pareto solutions by utilizing a membership function. Finally, the method is tested on the instances, which are extracted from historical data at Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Pareto solutions achieved by the proposed method are compared with those of other methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient for solving the LCSTD problem. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lockage co-scheduling; orthogonal design; Three Gorges Dam; time-area series assignment","Dams; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Locks (fasteners); Membership functions; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Scheduling; Ships; Co-scheduling; Mixed-integer nonlinear optimization; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Orthogonal design; Parallel optimization; Three Gorges Dam; Time optimization; time-area series assignment; Problem solving","","","Manuscript received April 29, 2016; revised October 17, 2016; accepted November 16, 2016.

The recently suggested non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III could obtain a fair diversity but the convergence is unsatisfactory. For this purpose, an improved NSGA-III algorithm based on objective space decomposition (we call it NSGA-III-OSD) is proposed for enhancing the convergence of NSGA-III. Firstly, the objective space is decomposed into several subspaces by clustering the weight vectors uniformly distributed in the whole objective space and each subspace has its own population. Secondly, individual information is exchanged between subspaces in the mating selection phase. Finally, the convergence information is added in the environmental selection phase by the penalty-based boundary intersection distance. The proposed NSGA-III-OSD is tested on a number of many-objective optimization problems with three to fifteen objectives and compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that NSGA-III-OSD is competitive with the chosen state-of-the-art designs in convergence and diversity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convergence; Many-objective optimization; NSGA-III; Objective space decomposition; PBI distance","Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Vector spaces; Vectors; Convergence; Many-objective optimizations; NSGA-III; Objective space; PBI distance; Algorithms","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61175126) and the International S&T Cooperation Program of China (Grant No. 2015DFG12150).","Adra, Salem Fawaz, Diversity management in evolutionary many-objective optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 15, 2, pp. 183-195, (2011); Asafuddoula, Md, A decomposition based evolutionary algorithm for many objective optimization with systematic sampling and adaptive epsilon control, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7811 LNCS, pp. 413-427, (2013); Bader, Johannes, HypE: An algorithm for fast hypervolume-based many-objective optimization, Evolutionary Computation, 19, 1, pp. 45-76, (2011); Practical Nonparametric Statistics, (1980); Pp, (2001); Das, Indraneel, Normal-boundary intersection: A new method for generating the Pareto surface in nonlinear multicriteria optimization problems, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 8, 3, pp. 631-657, (1998); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Evaluating the ε-domination based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for a quick computation of Pareto-optimal solutions, Evolutionary Computation, 13, 4, pp. 501-525, (2005); Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Theoretical Advances and Applications, (2005); Complex Systems, (1995)","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","","","","","14327643; 14337479","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969916084"

The relationships between Supply Chain Management (SCM) and ICs have been imperfectly mathematically investigated, in spite of their intrinsic correlation. To bridge this gap, a bi-objective multi-echelon supply-distribution model is firstly proposed in this paper to optimize collaborations of different echelons. The considered problem is then solved using a recently introduced metaheuristic algorithm, the intelligent water drops (IWD) algorithm in terms of a multi-objective approach. The IWD is then compared with two well-known algorithms, reference-point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA). The two considered objectives are 1) minimizing the total incurred logistics costs, and 2) maximizing the service level of customers. The small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) positioned in IC as manufacturers profit from using a 3PL-managed supply-demand hub in industrial cluster (SDHIC) as a public provider of warehousing and logistics services.

These applications require quality-of-service (QoS) aware multicast routing protocol to deliver the same data stream to a predefined group of receivers. Since nodes in wireless networks are severely energy constrained due to finite battery source, hence it is of paramount importance that QoS aware multicast routing protocol be energy efficient. Transmission power control is one of the methods used to save energy. In this method, the nodes dynamically adjust the transmission power so that energy consumption in the tree is minimized. However, reduction in the transmission power increases the number of forwarding nodes in the multicast tree. This negatively impacts the QoS in terms of propagation delay, delay jitter, and packet loss etc. In wireless networks, there is a trade-off between the energy consumption and the QoS guarantees provided by the network. We unify these requirements into a multiobjective framework referred to as Energy Efficient QoS Multicast Routing (E2QoSMR). The goal is to simultaneously optimize the total power consumption and the QoS parameters in the multicast tree. We extend two algorithms based on metaphor of swarm intelligence for finding an energy efficient multicast tree satisfying the QoS guarantees. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the correctness and efficiency of the algorithms. The simulation result of the algorithms is compared with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-III. The experimental results are consolidated by statistical analyses that demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to generate the Pareto optimal solution set. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ant colony optimization; Multicast tree; Multiobjective optimization; QoS; Wireless networks","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Multicasting; Multiobjective optimization; Network routing; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Power control; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Swarm intelligence; Video conferencing; Wireless networks; Extensive simulations; Multicast routing protocol; Multicast tree; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Pareto optimal solutions; Real time multimedia applications; Total power consumption; Transmission power control; Quality of service","","","","Mohapatra, Prasant, Group Communications in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, Computer, 37, 2, pp. 52-59, (2004); Chakrabarti, Satyabrata, QoS issues in ad hoc wireless networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 39, 2, pp. 142-148, (2001); Zhang, Baoxian, QoS routing for wireless ad hoc networks: Problems, algorithms, and protocols, IEEE Communications Magazine, 43, 10, pp. 110-117, (2005); Tamma, Bheemarjuna Reddy, Quality of service provisioning in ad hoc wireless networks: A survey of issues and solutions, Ad Hoc Networks, 4, 1, pp. 83-124, (2006); Wang, Zheng, Quality-of-service routing for supporting multimedia applications, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 14, 7, pp. 1228-1234, (1996); Ephremides, Anthony, Energy concerns in wireless networks, IEEE Wireless Communications, 9, 4, pp. 48-59, (2002); Goldsmith, Andréa J., Design challenges for energy-constrained ad hoc wireless networks, IEEE Wireless Communications, 9, 4, pp. 8-27, (2002); Li, Jiageng, Power-aware routing protocols in ad hoc wireless networks, IEEE Wireless Communications, 12, 6, pp. 69-81, (2005); Meo, M., Research challenges on energy-efficient networking design, Computer Communications, 50, pp. 187-195, (2014); Krunz, Marwan M., Transmission power control in wireless ad hoc networks: Challenges, solutions, and open issues, IEEE Network, 18, 5, pp. 8-14, (2004)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15684946","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012988637"

If applied well, refactoring can improve different aspects of software quality including readability, maintainability, and extendibility. However, despite its importance and benefits, recent studies report that automated refactoring tools are underused much of the time by software developers. This paper introduces an automated approach for refactoring recommendation, called MORE, driven by 3 objectives: (1) to improve design quality (as defined by software quality metrics), (2) to fix code smells, and (3) to introduce design patterns. To this end, we adopt the recent nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-III, to find the best trade-off between these 3 objectives. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach using a benchmark of 7 medium and large open-source systems, 7 commonly occurring code smells (god class, feature envy, data class, spaghetti code, shotgun surgery, lazy class, and long parameter list), and 4 common design pattern types (visitor, factory method, singleton, and strategy). Our approach is empirically evaluated through a quantitative and qualitative study to compare it against 3 different state-of-the art approaches, 2 popular multiobjective search algorithms, and random search. The statistical analysis of the results confirms the efficacy of our approach in improving the quality of the studied systems while successfully fixing 84% of code smells and introducing an average of 6 design patterns. In addition, the qualitative evaluation shows that most of the suggested refactorings (an average of 69%) are considered by developers to be relevant and meaningful. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","code smells; design patterns; refactoring; search-based software engineering; software quality","Codes (symbols); Computer software selection and evaluation; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Object oriented programming; Odors; Open source software; Quality control; Code smell; Design Patterns; Refactorings; Search-based software engineering; Software Quality; Open systems","","","The authors would like to thank all the participants to this study.

However, most many-objective evolutionary algorithms have only been evaluated on benchmark test functions and few applied to real-world optimization problems. To move a step forward, this paper presents a case study of solving a many-objective hybrid electric vehicle controller design problem using three state-of-the-art algorithms, namely, a decomposition based evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D), a non-dominated sorting based genetic algorithm (NSGA-III), and a reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA). We start with a typical setting aimed at approximating the Pareto front without introducing any user preferences. Based on the analyses of the approximated Pareto front, we introduce a preference articulation method and embed it in the three evolutionary algorithms for identifying solutions that the decision-maker prefers. Our experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating user preferences into many-objective evolutionary algorithms, we are not only able to gain deep insight into the trade-off relationships between the objectives, but also to achieve high-quality solutions reflecting the decision-maker's preferences. In addition, our experimental results indicate that each of the three algorithms examined in this work has its unique advantages that can be exploited when applied to the optimization of real-world problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithm; hybrid electric vehicle; many-objective optimization; preference articulation; reference vector","Benchmarking; Control system synthesis; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Decision maker's preferences; Guided evolutionary algorithms; High-quality solutions; Many-objective optimizations; Real-world optimization; Reference vectors; State-of-the-art algorithms; Trade-off relationship; Hybrid vehicles","","","","Marler, R.

Those algorithms often show surprisingly good performance on widely used DTLZ and WFG test problems. The performance of those algorithms has continued to be improved. The aim of this paper is to show our concern that such a performance improvement race may lead to the overspecialization of developed algorithms for the frequently used many-objective test problems. In this paper, we first explain the DTLZ and WFG test problems. Next, we explain many-objective evolutionary algorithms characterized by the use of systematically generated weight vectors. Then we discuss the relation between the features of the test problems and the search mechanisms of weight vector-based algorithms such as multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), MOEA/dominance and decomposition (MOEA/DD), and θ-dominance based evolutionary algorithm (θ-DEA). Through computational experiments, we demonstrate that a slight change in the problem formulations of DTLZ and WFG deteriorates the performance of those algorithms. After explaining the reason for the performance deterioration, we discuss the necessity of more general test problems and more flexible algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms; many-objective evolutionary algorithms; many-objective optimization; many-objective test problems","Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Testing; Computational experiment; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Overspecialization; Performance deterioration; Problem formulation; Test problem; Evolutionary algorithms","","","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under Grant KAKENHI 24300090, Grant KAKENHI 26540128, and Grant KAKENHI 16H02877.","Ishibuchi, Hisao, Review of coevolutionary developments of evolutionary multi-objective and many-objective algorithms and test problems, pp. 178-184, (2015); Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, (1993); Evolutionary Computation, (1994); Horn, Jeffrey A., Niched Pareto genetic algorithm for multiobjective optimization, 1, pp. 82-87, (1994); Zitzler, Eckart, Comparison of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: empirical results., Evolutionary Computation, 8, 2, pp. 173-195, (2000); Zitzler, Eckart, Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: A comparative case study and the strength Pareto approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 3, 4, pp. 257-271, (1999); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, (2001); Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Theoretical Advances and Applications, (2005); Huband, Simon T., A review of multiobjective test problems and a scalable test problem toolkit, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 10, 5, pp. 477-506, (2006)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018503940"

However, the decision space performance analysis is a recent and relatively less explored topic in evolutionary multi-objective optimization research. Among other implications, such analysis can lead to designing more realistic test problems, gaining better understanding about optimal and robust design areas, and design and evaluation of knowledge-based optimization algorithms. This paper complements the existing research in this area and proposes a new method to generate multi-objective optimization test problems with clustered Pareto sets in hyper-rectangular defined areas of decision space. The test problem is parametrized to control number of decision variables, number and position of optimal areas in the decision space and modality of fitness landscape. Three leading MOEAs, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D, are evaluated on a number of problem instances with varying characteristics. A new metric is proposed that measures the performance of algorithms in terms of their coverage of the optimal areas in the decision space. The empirical analysis presented in this research shows that the decision space performance may not necessarily be reflective of the objective space performance and that all algorithms are sensitive to population size parameter for the new test problems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","decision space analysis; Evolutionary multi-objective optimization; knowledge-based MOEA; performance metric; test problems","Benchmarking; Evolutionary algorithms; Knowledge based systems; Optimization; Population statistics; Testing; Decision space; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Knowledge based; Performance metrices; Test problem; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Coello, Carlos A., Evolutionary multi-objective optimization: A historical view of the field, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 1, 1, pp. 28-36, (2006); Zhou, Aimin Min, Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: A survey of the state of the art, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 1, 1, pp. 32-49, (2011); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Advances in evolutionary multi-objective optimization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7515 LNCS, pp. 1-26, (2012); Zitzler, Eckart, Comparison of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: empirical results., Evolutionary Computation, 8, 2, pp. 173-195, (2000); Deb, Kalyanmoy, Scalable multi-objective optimization test problems, 1, pp. 825-830, (2002); Huband, Simon T., A review of multiobjective test problems and a scalable test problem toolkit, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 10, 5, pp. 477-506, (2006); Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms Classifications Analyses and New Innovations, (1999); Coello, Carlos A., A study of the parallelization of a coevolutionary multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2972, pp. 688-697, (2004); Parallel Problem Solving from Nature Ppsn Ix, (2006); Preuss, Mike, Decision space diversity can be essential for solving multiobjective real-world problems, Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, 634, pp. 367-377, (2010)","","World Scientific Publishing Co.","","","","","","14690268; 17575885","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016199865"

During the search process, non-dominated solutions are differentiated only by their local crowding or contribution to hypervolume or using a similar other metric. Thus, during evolution and even at the final iteration, the true convergence behavior of each non-dominated solutions from the Pareto optimal set is unknown. Recent studies have used Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to develop a KKT Proximity Measure (KKTPM) for estimating proximity of a solution from Pareto optimal set for a multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we integrate KKTPM with a recently proposed EMO algorithm to enhance its convergence properties towards the true Pareto optimal front. Specifically, we use KKTPM to identify poorly converged non-dominated solutions in every generation and apply an achievement scalarizing function based local search procedure to improve their convergence. Assisted by the KKTPM, the modified algorithm is designed in a way that maintains the total number of function evaluations as low as possible while making use of local search where it is most needed. Simulations on both constrained and unconstrained multi- and many objectives optimization problems demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm significantly improves the overall convergence properties. This study brings evolutionary optimization closer to mainstream optimization field and should motivate researchers to utilize KKTPM measure further within EMO and other numerical optimization algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","EMO; KKT; Local; NSGA-III; Search","Constrained optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Iterative methods; Local search (optimization); Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Evolutionary multi-criterion optimizations; Evolutionary optimizations; Local; Multi-objective optimization problem; Nondominated solutions; NSGA-III; Numerical optimization algorithms; Search; Optimization","","","","Multiobjective Decision Making Theory and Methodology, (1983); undefined; undefined; Horn, Jeffrey A., Niched Pareto genetic algorithm for multiobjective optimization, 1, pp. 82-87, (1994); Evolutionary Computation, (1994); undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Zitzler, Eckart, Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: A comparative case study and the strength Pareto approach, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 3, 4, pp. 257-271, (1999)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03050548","","CMORA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006056291"

Usually, these vector ranking schemes in the classical MOEAs are of high computational complexity. Thus, in recent years, many researchers put emphasis on the further improvement of the computational complexity of the vector ranking schemes. In this paper, we propose the dominance degree matrix for a set of vectors and design a fast method to construct this new data structure, which requires O (mNlog N) comparisons on average. The dominance degree matrix is constructed based on the properties of Pareto domination, and it can convert the dominance comparison into counting the number of special element pairs. Based on the dominance degree matrix, we develop a new and efficient implementation of nondominated sorting called dominance degree approach for nondominated sorting (DDA-NS), which has an average time complexity of O (mN2) but only requires O (mNlog N) objective function value comparisons on average. Empirical results demonstrate that DDA-NS clearly outperforms six other representative approaches for nondominated sorting in most cases and DDA-NS performs well when dealing with large-size and many-objective populations. In addition, we also use the dominance degree matrix to form a new method for calculating the dominance strength for Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA)2, which greatly improves the efficiency of the naive calculation method in SPEA2. Experiments on benchmark problems show that the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)-II and NSGA-III framework embedding DDA-NS and the SPEA2 framework embedding the new method of calculating the dominance strength indeed achieve the improvement of the runtime. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-/many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA); nondominated sorting; Pareto-optimality; run-time complexity; vector ranking","Computational complexity; Genetic algorithms; Matrix algebra; Pareto principle; Sorting; Vectors; Efficient implementation; Multi-/many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA); Non-dominated Sorting; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Objective function values; Pareto-optimality; Run time complexity; Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","Genetic Algorithms in Search Optimization and Machine Learning, (1989); Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, (1985); Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, (1993); Horn, Jeffrey A., Niched Pareto genetic algorithm for multiobjective optimization, 1, pp. 82-87, (1994); Evolutionary Computation, (1994); Kennedy, James, Particle swarm optimization, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks - Conference Proceedings, 4, pp. 1942-1948, (1995); Coello, Carlos A., MOPSO: A proposal for multiple objective particle swarm optimization, 2, pp. 1051-1056, (2002); Goh, Chikeong, A competitive and cooperative co-evolutionary approach to multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm design, European Journal of Operational Research, 202, 1, pp. 42-54, (2010); Dorigo, Marco, Ant colony optimization artificial ants as a computational intelligence technique, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 1, 4, pp. 28-39, (2006); Doerner, Karl Franz, Pareto ant colony optimization with ILP preprocessing in multiobjective project portfolio selection, European Journal of Operational Research, 171, 3, pp. 830-841, (2006)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","1089778X","","ITEVF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014963620"

Data features in intrusion detection systems (IDS) always present the problem of imbalanced classification in which some classifications only have a few instances while others have many instances. This imbalance can obviously limit classification efficiency, but few efforts have been made to address it. In this paper, a scheme for the many-objective problem is proposed for feature selection in IDS, which uses two strategies, namely, a special domination method and a predefined multiple targeted search, for population evolution. It can differentiate traffic not only between normal and abnormal but also by abnormality type. Based on our scheme, NSGA-III is used to obtain an adequate feature subset with good performance. An improved many-objective optimization algorithm (I-NSGA-III) is further proposed using a novel niche preservation procedure. It consists of a bias-selection process that selects the individual with the fewest selected features and a fit-selection process that selects the individual with the maximum sum weight of its objectives. Experimental results show that I-NSGA-III can alleviate the imbalance problem with higher classification accuracy for classes having fewer instances. Moreover, it can achieve both higher classification accuracy and lower computational complexity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature selection; IDS; Many-objective optimization; Network anomaly detection","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computational complexity; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Optimization; Classification accuracy; Classification efficiency; Imbalance problem; Imbalanced classification; Intrusion Detection Systems; Many-objective optimizations; Network anomaly detection; Population evolution; Feature extraction","","","This work was supported in part by: (i) the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61602314, 61672358 and 61402291); (ii) the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (Grant No. 2016A030313043); (iii) Fundamental Research Project in the Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen (Grant Nos.

Thus, modular design is a desirable property for model transformations as it can significantly improve their evolution, comprehensibility, maintainability, reusability, and thus, their overall quality. Although language support for modularization of model transformations is emerging, model transformations are created as monolithic artifacts containing a huge number of rules. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of automatically modularizing model transformation programs was not addressed before in the current literature. These programs written in transformation languages, such as ATL, are implemented as one main module including a huge number of rules. To tackle this problem and improve the quality and maintainability of model transformation programs, we propose an automated search-based approach to modularize model transformations based on higher-order transformations. Their application and execution is guided by our search framework which combines an in-place transformation engine and a search-based algorithm framework. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by using ATL as concrete transformation language and NSGA-III as search algorithm to find a trade-off between different well-known conflicting design metrics for the fitness functions to evaluate the generated modularized solutions. To validate our approach, we apply it to a comprehensive dataset of model transformations. As the study shows, ATL transformations can be modularized automatically, efficiently, and effectively by our approach. We found that, on average, the majority of recommended modules, for all the ATL programs, by NSGA-III are considered correct with more than 84 percent of precision and 86 percent of recall when compared to manual solutions provided by active developers. The statistical analysis of our experiments over several runs shows that NSGA-III performed significantly better than multi-objective algorithms and random search. We were not able to compare with existing model transformations modularization approaches since our study is the first to address this problem. The software developers considered in our experiments confirm the relevance of the recommended modularization solutions for several maintenance activities based on different scenarios and interviews. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ATL; MDE; Model transformation; Modularization; NSGA-III; SBSE","Economic and social effects; Iterative methods; Maintainability; Modular construction; Optimization; Reusability; Many-objective optimizations; Model transformation; Modularizations; Multi objective algorithm; NSGA-III; SBSE; Search-based algorithms; Transformation languages; Program debugging","","","This work has been partially supported by the Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft and the BMWFW, Austria, by the European Commission (FEDER), by Spanish Government under CICYT project BELI (TIN2015-70560-R), the excellence network SEBASE (TIN2015-71841-REDT), the Andalusian Government project COPAS (P12-TIC-1867), and by the Ford Motor Company (Ford Alliance Program).","Czarnecki, Krzysztof, Feature-based survey of model transformation approaches, IBM Systems Journal, 45, 3, pp. 621-645, (2006); Lücio, Levi, Model transformation intents and their properties, Software and Systems Modeling, 15, 3, pp. 647-684, (2016); Kusel, Angelika, Reuse in model-to-model transformation languages: are we there yet?, Software and Systems Modeling, 14, 2, pp. 537-572, (2015); Atl Zoo, (2015); 2nd Workshop on the Analysis of Model Transformations Amt@models 13, (2013); Kurtev, Ivan, Rule-based modularization in model transformation languages illustrated with ATL, Science of Computer Programming, 68, 3, pp. 138-154, (2007); Harman, Mark, The current state and future of search based software engineering, pp. 342-357, (2007); Deb, Kalyanmoy, An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, Part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18, 4, pp. 577-601, (2014); Rodrigues da Silva, Alberto Rodrigues, Model-driven engineering: A survey supported by the unified conceptual model, Computer Languages, Systems and Structures, 43, pp. 139-155, (2015); Model Driven Software Engineering in Practice, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","00985589","","IESED","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025128979"

A reference points-based evolutionary algorithm (RPEA) was proposed in this paper to solve many-objective optimization problems. The aim of this study is to exploit the potential of the reference points-based approach to strengthen the selection pressure towards the Pareto front while maintaining an extensive and uniform distribution among solutions. In RPEA, a series of reference points with good performances in convergence and distribution are continuously generated according to the current population to guide the evolution. Furthermore, superior individuals are selected based on the evaluation of each individual by calculating the distances between the reference points and the individual in the objective space. The proposed algorithm was applied to seven benchmark optimization problems and compared with ɛ-MOEA, HypE, MOEA/D and NSGA-III. The results empirically show that the proposed algorithm has a good adaptability to problems with irregular or degenerate Pareto fronts, whereas the other reference points-based algorithms do not. Moreover, it outperforms the other four in 8 out of 21 test instances, demonstrating that it has an advantage in obtaining a Pareto optimal set with good performances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distance; Evolutionary optimization; Many-objective optimization; Multi-objective optimization; Reference point","Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Distance; Evolutionary optimization method; Evolutionary optimizations; Many-objective optimizations; Optimization problems; Pareto-optimal sets; Reference points; Uniform distribution; Optimization","","","This work was jointly supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China with grant No. 61375067 , 61673404, 61105063, and 61075061, National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) with grant No. 2014CB046306-2 , Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province with grant No. BK2012566, Innovation Project for College Graduates of Jiangsu Province with grant No. KYLX15_1422 .","Reed, Patrick M., Evolving many-objective water management to exploit exascale computing, Water Resources Research, 50, 10, pp. 8367-8373, (2014); Sayyad, Abdel Salam, On the value of user preferences in search-based software engineering: A case study in software product lines, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 492-501, (2013); Han, Yuyan, An improved NSGA-II algorithm for multi-objective lot-streaming flow shop scheduling problem, International Journal of Production Research, 52, 8, pp. 2211-2231, (2014); Deb, Kalyanmoy, A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6, 2, pp. 182-197, (2002); Spea2 Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm, (2001); Coello, Carlos A., MOPSO: A proposal for multiple objective particle swarm optimization, 2, pp. 1051-1056, (2002); Ishibuchi, Hisao, Evolutionary many-objective optimization: A short review, pp. 2419-2426, (2008); Multiple Criteria Decision Making Theory and Applications, (1980); International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research, (2006); Mohammadi, Asad, Reference point based multi-objective optimization through decomposition, (2012)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","15684946","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002693740"

The majority of existing work treats software engineering problems from a single or bi-objective point of view, where the main goal is to maximize or minimize one or two objectives. However, most software engineering problems are naturally complex in which many conflicting objectives need to be optimized. Software refactoring is one of these problems involving finding a compromise between several quality attributes to improve the quality of the system while preserving the behavior. To this end, we propose a novel representation of the refactoring problem as a many-objective one where every quality attribute to improve is considered as an independent objective to be optimized. In our approach based on the recent NSGA-III algorithm, the refactoring solutions are evaluated using a set of 8 distinct objectives. We evaluated this approach on one industrial project and seven open source systems. We compared our findings to: several other many-objective techniques (IBEA, MOEA/D, GrEA, and DBEA-Eps), an existing multi-objective approach a mono-objective technique and an existing refactoring technique not based on heuristic search.

In this paper, we investigate a multiobjective SSPP, which aims to optimize the ship stability and the number of rehandles simultaneously. We use metacentric height, list value, and trim value to measure the ship stability. Meanwhile, the number of rehandles is the sum of rehandles by yard cranes and quay cranes and all necessary rehandles at future ports. To solve this problem, a variant of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) combined with a local search component is proposed. The algorithm can produce a set of nondominated solutions. Decision makers can then choose the most promising solution for practical implementation based on their experience and preferences.

Despite some efforts in unifying different types of mono-objective evolutionary and non-EAs, researchers are not interested enough in unifying all three types of optimization problems together. Such a unified algorithm will allow users to work with a single software enabling one-time implementation of solution representation, operators, objectives, and constraints formulations across several objective dimensions. For the first time, we propose a unified evolutionary optimization algorithm for solving all three classes of problems specified above, based on the recently proposed elitist, guided nondominated sorting procedure, developed for solving many-objectives problems. Using a new niching-based selection procedure, our proposed unified algorithm automatically degenerates to an efficient equivalent population-based algorithm for each class. No extra parameters are needed. Extensive simulations are performed on unconstrained and constrained test problems having single-, two-, multi-, and many-objectives and on two engineering optimization design problems. Performance of the unified approach is compared to suitable population-based counterparts at each dimensional level.

This paper presents a multiobjective optimization model and an efficient solution algorithm for a one- or two-stage midblock crosswalk on an arterial section. The proposed model aims to produce the optimal location and corresponding signal settings to balance the trade-off between pedestrian delays and vehicular bandwidth when the signals of the crosswalk and adjacent intersections are coordinated. The proposed model has three distinguishing features: (i) the costs for both pedestrians and vehicles are considered in a unified framework; (ii) the location and signal settings of the midblock crosswalk are simultaneously optimized; and (iii) a multiobjective optimization approach is developed to study the effectiveness of the midblock crosswalk under conditions in which the priorities between pedestrian and vehicle flows differ. A nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II)-based algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. The results of the case study showed that the proposed model would help traffic practitioners, researchers, and authorities properly locate and signalize a one- or two-stage midblock pedestrian crosswalk on an arterial section. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","location; midblock crosswalk; NSGAII; signalization","Crosswalks; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Location; Optimization; Pedestrian safety; Timing circuits; Adjacent intersections; Critical operational issues; Integrated optimization; Multi-objective optimization models; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); NSGA-II; signalization; Solution algorithms; Multiobjective optimization","","","The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant nos. 51238008 and 51178345.

This study considers an X-bar control chart design problem with multiple and often conflicting objectives, including the expected time the process remains in statistical control status, the type-I error, and the detection power. An integrated multi-objective algorithm is proposed for optimizing economical control chart design. We applied multi-objective optimization methods founded on the reference-points-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-III) and a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Then, two different multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, including data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), are used to reduce the number of Pareto optimal solutions to a manageable size. Four DEA methods compare the optimal solutions based on relative efficiency, and then the TOPSIS method ranks the efficient optimal solutions. Several metrics are used to compare the performance of the NSGA-III and MOPSO algorithms. In addition, the DEA and TOPSIS methods are used to compare the performance of NSGA-III and MOPSO. A well-known case study is formulated and solved to demonstrate the applicability and exhibit the efficacy of the proposed optimization algorithm. In addition, several numerical examples are developed to compare the NSGA-III and MOPSO algorithms. Results show that NSGA-III performs better in generating efficient optimal solutions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data envelopment analysis; Economical control chart design; MOPSO algorithm; NSGA-III algorithm; TOPSIS","Algorithms; Control charts; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Design; Flowcharting; Genetic algorithms; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Process control; Screening; Statistical process control; Control chart design; Multi objective algorithm; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Multi-objective control; Multiple criteria decision making; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Pareto optimal solutions; TOPSIS; Multiobjective optimization","","","","Asadzadeh, Shervin, Multiple-objective design of an X̄ control chart with multiple assignable causes, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 43, 3-4, pp. 312-322, (2009); Banker, Rajiv D., Estimating most productive scale size using data envelopment analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 17, 1, pp. 35-44, (1984); Del Castillo, Enrique, Multiple-criteria optimal design of X¯ control charts, IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers), 28, 6, pp. 467-474, (1996); Celano, Giovanni, Multiobjective economic design of an X control chart, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 37, 1, pp. 129-132, (1999); Charnes, Abraham, Measuring the efficiency of decision making units, European Journal of Operational Research, 2, 6, pp. 429-444, (1978); Chen, Yankwang, Multi-criteria design of an X̄ control chart, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 46, 4 SPEC.

In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm based on a new dominance relation is proposed for many-objective optimization. The proposed evolutionary algorithm aims to enhance the convergence of the recently suggested nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III by exploiting the fitness evaluation scheme in the MOEA based on decomposition, but still inherit the strength of the former in diversity maintenance. In the proposed algorithm, the nondominated sorting scheme based on the introduced new dominance relation is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, ensuring both convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of well-known benchmark problems having 3-15 objectives and compared against eight state-of-the-art algorithms. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can work well on almost all the test functions considered in this paper, and it is compared favorably with the other many-objective optimizers.

MOEA/D decomposes a multi-objective optimization problem into a number of single objective optimization problems. Each single objective optimization problem is defined by a scalarizing function using a weight vector. In MOEA/D, there are several scalarizing approaches such as weighted Tchebycheff, reciprocal weighted Tchebycheff, weighted sum (WS) and penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI). Each scalarizing function has a characteristic effect on the search performance of MOEA/D and provides a scenario of multi-objective solution search. To improve the availability of MOEA/D framework for solving various kinds of problems, it is important to provide a new scalarizing function which has different characteristics from the conventional scalarizing functions. In particular, the conventional scalarizing approaches face a difficulty to approximate a widely spread Pareto front in some problems. To approximate the entire Pareto front by improving the spread of solutions in the objective space and enhance the search performance of MOEA/D in multi and many-objective optimization problems, in this work we propose the inverted PBI scalarizing approach which is an extension of the conventional PBI and WS. In this work, we analyze differences between inverted PBI and other scalarizing functions, and compare the search performances of NSGA-III and five MOEA/Ds using weighted Tchebycheff, reciprocal weighted Tchebycheff, WS, PBI and inverted PBI in many-objective knapsack problems and WFG4 problems with 2–8 objectives. As results, we show that the inverted PBI based MOEA/D achieves higher search performance than other algorithms in problems with many-objectives and the difficulty to approximate a widely spread Pareto front in the objective space. Also, we show the robustness of the inverted PBI on Pareto front geometry by using problems with four representative concave, linear, convex and discontinuous Pareto fronts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary multi-objective optimization; MOEA/D; Scalarizing functions","Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Evolutionary approach; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Many-objective optimizations; MOEA/D; Multi-objective optimization problem; Scalarizing function; Search performance; Single objective optimization problems; Multiobjective optimization","","","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 26730129.","Aguirre, Hernán E., Working principles, behavior, and performance of MOEAs on MNK-landscapes, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1670-1690, (2007); Aguirre, Hernán E., Adaptive ε-sampling and ε-hood for evolutionary many-objective optimization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7811 LNCS, pp. 322-336, (2013); Auger, Anne, Articulating user preferences in many-objective problems by sampling the weighted hypervolume, pp. 555-562, (2009); Beume, Nicola, SMS-EMOA: Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume, European Journal of Operational Research, 181, 3, pp. 1653-1669, (2007); Multiple Criteria Decision Making, (1976); Brockhoff, Dimo, Are all objectives necessary?

We use multi-objective mathematical programming to solve this problem with three conflicting objectives including: (i) minimizing the total production costs; (ii) leveling the production volume in different production periods; and (iii) producing a solution which is as close as possible to the just-in-time level.

To improve convergence and diversity for MaOPs, we propose a new approach: clustering-ranking evolutionary algorithm (crEA), where the two procedures (clustering and ranking) are implemented sequentially. Clustering incorporates the recently proposed non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), using a series of reference lines as the cluster centroid. The solutions are ranked according to the fitness value, which is considered to be the degree of closeness to the true Pareto front. An environmental selection operation is performed on every cluster to promote both convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm has been tested extensively on nine widely used benchmark problems from the walking fish group (WFG) as well as combinatorial travelling salesman problem (TSP). An extensive comparison with six state-of-the-art algorithms indicates that the proposed crEA is capable of finding a better approximated and distributed solution set. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clustering; Convergence; Diversity; Many-objective optimization; Ranking","Algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Traveling salesman problem; Clustering; Convergence; Diversity; Many-objective optimizations; Ranking; Clustering algorithms","","","","Khare, Vineet R., Performance scaling of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2632, pp. 376-390, (2003); Fleming, P.

To handle the complexity of systems, software products are, in general, decomposed in terms of packages/modules containing classes that are dependent. However, it is challenging to automatically remodularize systems to improve their maintainability. The majority of existing remodularization work mainly satisfy one objective which is improving the structure of packages by optimizing coupling and cohesion. In addition, most of existing studies are limited to only few operation types such as move class and split packages. Many other objectives, such as the design semantics, reducing the number of changes and maximizing the consistency with development change history, are important to improve the quality of the software by remodularizing it. In this article, we propose a novel many-objective search-based approach using NSGA-III. The process aims at finding the optimal remodularization solutions that improve the structure of packages, minimize the number of changes, preserve semantics coherence, and reuse the history of changes. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using four different open-source systems and one automotive industry project, provided by our industrial partner, through a quantitative and qualitative study conducted with software engineers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Remodularization; Search-based software engineering; Software maintenance; Software quality","Automotive industry; Computer software maintenance; Computer software selection and evaluation; Open source software; Semantics; Software engineering; Industrial partners; Open source system; Qualitative study; Remodularization; Search-based software engineering; Software products; Software Quality; Software systems; Open systems","","","","Abdeen, Hani, Automatic package coupling and cycle minimization, Proceedings - Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, WCRE, pp. 103-112, (2009); Abdeen, Hani, Modularization metrics: Assessing package organization in legacy large object-oriented software, Proceedings - Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, WCRE, pp. 394-398, (2011); Abdeen, Hani, Towards automatically improving package structure while respecting original design decisions, Proceedings - Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, WCRE, pp. 212-221, (2013); Anquetil, Nicolas, Experiments with clustering as a software remodularization method, Reverse Engineering - Working Conference Proceedings, pp. 235-255, (1999); Arcuri, Andrea, A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1-10, (2011); Arcuri, Andrea, Parameter tuning or default values?

However, resource leveling does not ensure optimized allocation of resources. Furthermore, the duration and cost of a project may increase after leveling resources. The objectives of resource allocation optimization used in our research are to (i) increase resource utilization, (ii) decrease project cost, and (iii) decrease project duration. We implemented three search-based software engineering algorithms, i.e. multiobjective genetic algorithm, multiobjective particle swarm algorithm (MOPSO), and elicit nondominated sorting evolutionary strategy. Twelve experiments to optimize the resource allocation are performed on a published case study. The experimental results are analyzed and compared in the form of Pareto fronts, average Pareto fronts, percent increase in resource utilization, percent decrease in project cost, and percent decrease in project duration. The experimental results show that MOPSO is the best technique for resource optimization because after optimization with MOPSO, resource utilization is increased and the project cost and duration are reduced. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evolutionary algorithms; Resource allocation; Resource allocation optimization; Search-based software engineering; Skills management","Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Resource allocation; Screening; Software engineering; Evolutionary strategies; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Non-dominated Sorting; Particle swarm algorithm; Resource allocation optimization; Resource optimization; Search-based software engineering; Skills managements; Computational complexity","","","","Antoniol, Giuliano, Search-based techniques for optimizing software project resource allocation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3103, pp. 1425-1426, (2004); Anwar, Zeeshan, Expertise based skill management model for effective project resource allocation under stress in software industry of Pakistan, 1, pp. 509-513, (2013); Computer and Information Science, (2010); Disadvantages of Cpm, (2013); A Pragmatic Framework Empirical Search Based Software Engineering Sbse to Optimize Resource Allocation for Software Projects, (2014); Bibi, Nazia, Project resource allocation optimization using search based software engineering-A framework, pp. 226-229, (2014); Chen, Weineng, Ant colony optimization for software project scheduling and staffing with an event-based scheduler, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 39, 1, pp. 1-17, (2013); Engineering Letters, (2006); Gerasimou, Simos, An investigation of optimal project scheduling and team staffing in software development using particle swarm optimization, 2 ISAS, SAIC/-, pp. 168-171, (2012); Gonsalves, Tad, Multi-objective optimization for software development projects, pp. 1-6, (2010)","","Walter de Gruyter GmbH","","","","","","2191026X; 03341860","","JISYE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988844621"

This is mainly due to the fact that these algorithms lack from ability to handle more than three objectives adequately. For this reason, researchers have been focusing in developing algorithms capable of addressing many-objective optimization problems. Recently, authors of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) have proposed an extension of this approach, called NSGA-III. This new approach has opened new directions for research and development to solve many-objective optimization problems. In this algorithm the maintenance of diversity among population members is aided by supplying a number of well-spread reference points. In this work, a comparative study of the performance of NSGA-II and NSGA-III was carried out. Our aim is to verify the effectiveness of NSGA-III to deal with many-objectives problems and extend the range of problems that this approach can solve. For this, the comparison was made addressing the project portfolio problem, using instances with three and nine objectives. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was partially financed by CONACYT, COTACYT, DGEST, TECNM and ITCM.","Multi Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, (2001); Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi Objective Problems, (2007); Talbi, El Ghazali, Metaheuristics: From Design to Implementation, (2009); Ieeexplore Ieee Org, (2013); Politique Cours Deconomie Rouge Lausanne, (1896); Zitzler, Eckart, Multiobjective optimization using evolutionary algorithms - A comparative case study, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1498 LNCS, pp. 292-301, (1998); Evolutionary Algorithms for Multiobjective Optimization Methods and Applications, (1999); Laumanns, Marco, A unified model for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with elitism, 1, pp. 46-53, (2000); While, Lyndon, A faster algorithm for calculating hypervolume, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 10, 1, pp. 29-38, (2006); While, Lyndon, A fast way of calculating exact hypervolumes, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 16, 1, pp. 86-95, (2012)","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","","","","","1860949X; 18609503","9783031963100; 9783642034510; 9783540768029; 9783642364051; 9783031852510; 9783540959717; 9783031534447; 9783642054402; 9783642327254; 9783030949099","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931266076"

While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper.

In this paper, we extend NSGA-III to solve generic constrained many-objective optimization problems. In the process, we also suggest three types of constrained test problems that are scalable to any number of objectives and provide different types of challenges to a many-objective optimizer. A previously suggested MOEA/D algorithm is also extended to solve constrained problems. Results using constrained NSGA-III and constrained MOEA/D show an edge of the former, particularly in solving problems with a large number of objectives. Furthermore, the NSGA-III algorithm is made adaptive in updating and including new reference points on the fly. The resulting adaptive NSGA-III is shown to provide a denser representation of the Pareto-optimal front, compared to the original NSGA-III with an identical computational effort. This, and the original NSGA-III paper, together suggest and amply test a viable evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm for handling constrained and unconstrained problems.

In the developed model of the problem, the constraints of selecting the nearest-facility along with the service level restriction are considered to bring the model closer to reality. Three objective functions are also considered including minimizing (I) sum of the aggregate travel and waiting times, (II) maximum idle time of all facilities, and (III) the budget required to cover the costs of establishing the selected facilities plus server staffing costs. Since the developed model of the problem is of an NP-hard type and inexact solutions are more probable to be obtained, soft computing techniques, specifically evolutionary computations, are generally used to cope with the lack of precision. From different terms of evolutionary computations, this paper proposes a Pareto-based meta-heuristic algorithm called multi-objective harmony search (MOHS) to solve the problem. To validate the results obtained, two popular algorithms including non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA) are utilized as well. In order to demonstrate the proposed methodology and to compare the performances in terms of Pareto-based solution measures, the Taguchi approach is first utilized to tune the parameters of the proposed algorithms, where a new response metric named multi-objective coefficient of variation (MOCV) is introduced. Then, the results of implementing the algorithms on some test problems show that the proposed MOHS outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of computational time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-objective facility location problem; Multi-objective harmony search; NRGA; NSGA-II; Queuing system; Soft computing","Facility location problem; Harmony search; NRGA; NSGA-II; Queuing systems; Heuristic algorithms; Location; Pareto principle; Queueing networks; Soft computing; Problem solving","","","","ReVelle, Charles S., Location analysis: A synthesis and survey, European Journal of Operational Research, 165, 1, pp. 1-19, (2005); Operations Research, (1963); Facility Location Applications and Theory, (2002); Melo, Teresa, Facility location and supply chain management - A review, European Journal of Operational Research, 196, 2, pp. 401-412, (2009); Bhattacharya, Ranjan, Solving conflicting bi-objective facility location problem by NSGA II evolutionary algorithm, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 51, 1-4, pp. 397-414, (2010); Ko, Mark, A review of soft computing applications in supply chain management, Applied Soft Computing, 10, 3, pp. 661-674, (2010); Shavandi, Hassan, A fuzzy queuing location model with a genetic algorithm for congested systems, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 181, 1, pp. 440-456, (2006); Boffey, T.
